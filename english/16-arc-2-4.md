Friday, January 8th, 2010

I got up early again at 5am, got breakfast and was on the computer doing research. I guess they had not changed the alarm yet because Mrs. Beckett came up stairs, and scowled at me briefly.

“I need my pain meds, and my money.”

“What do you need your money for?”

“To get a haircut.” I did really need such, but I really need to go to several stores. Mrs. Beckett just fought back a yawn and went downstairs.

I was ready with my free camera, positioning myself to watch the safe numbers as she opened it committing more to memory. She came back up and handed me my pain pills.

“How much for your haircut? You have counseling today.”

“I know I do, I need all my money.”

“A haircut does not cost 120 dollars. Here’s 10.”

I was pretty sure I wasn’t going to get a specialty in speech until I actual knew what to aim for so I just activated it anyway. “That’s a cheap-o haircut that wouldn’t even cover sales tax. My looks require something better. Plus I need better shampoo, and you know I don’t even have my own personal deodorant yet? Buying some would make me and the rest of the house much happier, what with me trying to go to the gym and all.”

She handed me only two more twenties. I was tired of this.

“I still would like the rest of my personal money.”

“A haircut still doesn’t cost that much.”

“Look Mrs. B. You obviously take very good care of your hair, but I doubt it comes cheap. It’s a shame the way marketers create these artificial price differences between men and women’s products, but If one of the girls had asked for money for what I just described I needed, do you think a mere 50 dollars would even remotely cover it? I’m just asking for a fair consideration. I want to make myself look good for school, make some good first impressions.” I swallowed my pain meds with my glass of OJ while she looked at me. She put my money down on the table and walked off.

Your Speech skill has increased by 1
You have unlocked the feature ‘Good First Impression’

I went back to free camera mode and watched her return my pill bottle to the safe. Then I looked over my skills and read the description for it. ‘If you make a good first impression, automatically add a one time, unadjusted CHA / 2 bonus to your relationship score for that person.’ Hmm, that’s neat I guess. Now that I was at an even level 5, I really did need to figure out a Speech specialty to aim for.

I’ve noticed a trend now, that for most skills, it seems to always stop gains at the next whole number. While this is good for specialties, it is bad for losing gains that might have gotten you further. If I had been at 99.99%, and did some action that normally would have granted a lot, including a lot of percentage points past the next level, I still get stopped at the next level at 0.00%. The only skills I have not seen that happen on are the Gamer skills, when I get level jumps or gain them normally, but those do not have specialties. Actually, come to think of it, I don’t think my resistance skills do that either, and I strongly suspect they also don’t have specialties. This might be another way of determining if a skill supports specialties or not, in case merely Observing it (once my attempt at a 'buildings' specialty is done with) doesn’t tell me. I suppose it makes sense. If you can’t gain a specialty in a skill, then there is no need to do a progress halt to provide a chance to gain one.

I wrote down the list of stores I'd need to check and could tell I'd not be back for lunch. I’d have to take the bus to there too. I wanted to go to the gym but won’t have time. I do want to get back in time for the counseling thing. It's proven to be the best way to re-gain stress points and grind Psychology, Empathy, and sometimes even Gamer’s Mind, in the least traumatic manner. I waited until 6am for the stupid motion alarm to be off, then wrote a note.

Going to some stores, gym and to get haircut, will eat lunch while out. Be back in time for trip to counseling. Simon

I decided not to ask permission, because they probably wouldn’t give it. Sure I'd get in trouble later, but I don’t care. To get that bonus XP or possibly finish that quest at all, I had to be on my own. I doubted they'd be willing to drive me around to specialty electronic stores with a lot of other crap to do. Then they'd also want to know why. I had $168 bucks and $50 something on that visa gift card they didn’t know about.

I placed my note on the table and snuck out the back door when the kitchen was empty. Then snuck around to the backyard gate and down the alley, putting on one of my new hoodies.

For performing a repeated action you may gain the ‘Stealth’ skill.

Oh hell yeah. I clicked ‘Yes’ right away. I may not be able to use Observe on it right now, but that sounds awesome. Would it have any specialties?

    Stealth (AGI, PER, WIS) (Active): Level: 1 (0.00%)

    Not just a magnificent bastard, but a sneaky one too. This represents your ability to move about unseen and undetected. Proper use of appropriate prepared equipment can aid you even more in remaining unnoticed.



I activated it right away. At least there was no silly stealth animation I had to make while moving. I used it right up to the bus stop. No one paid attention but also didn’t react when they did turn and see me. It 'broke' when I was noticed and I couldn't turn it back on if I was being looked at. I succeeded one more and tried to board. It broke again when the bus driver demanded fare. Still, it had gone up slowly. Trying to activate it again on the bus, it just failed repeatedly. Too many eyes on me I guess. So instead I just started grinding Observe on all the buildings as we drove by.

****​

By the third store I found a sim reader that was compatible Julia’s Dad’s old obsolete flip phone. During the bus rides, I got a little practice with Meditation, but as soon as we hit a bump I'd get jostled and drop out of it. That happened enough to get annoying. Stealth rose very slowly. Trying it out during the day inside well lit stores wasn't a good grinding strategy for early levels.

After using Observe on 300 something buildings I finally got ‘Architectural Eye’ as a specialty. Good, now I’m back to level 9 and 0.00% again. I won’t aim for a specialty this level, because I should unlock a feature at level 10. I confirmed that buildings now only cost 2 MP. I’ll go for another eventually. Vehicles: (cars, trucks, even a plane and helicopter I saw flying overhead) still cost 3 MP. After that I don’t know what else to try for, maybe nothing.

Once I got the specialty, I woke up my Golem, but left it in my backpack doing nothing except passively gaining me skill for being awake. I didn’t want to do it before because it would drain my MP too fast. Shit, I should’ve done that last night, and avoided mana losses. Note to self, create a Golem wake time schedule to never waste MP again.

After the cost of the USB sim reader, a bag of desiccant packs, tools for dissembling a smartphone (in case I needed them), a haircut (I got a mid-price one anyway), and various sundries, I had drained off my visa gift card plus another 10 bucks and change. I did at least buy myself my own MP3 player so I would not have to borrow Julia’s anymore.

I skipped lunch and kept the Golem awake for the ride home. When I got back the Beckett’s were pissed, but I was beyond caring. I faked disgruntlement at my loss of TV privileges, when honestly I could not care less. They went through my shit and the few receipts I had kept, the ones I wanted them to find. I should have been more careful though, they wondered what the hell the golem was, but I put it to sleep right before they went through my stuff. ‘Just some crappy artwork’ was my only reply.

My annoyance was interrupted when I saw Julia on the landline and that her overhead tag now said ‘Level 13.’ The fuck? “Observe”

    Summary Description:
    Born 9/24/1994, Julia is a 15 year old fellow survivor from the Galveston 2009 Leviathan attack in which she lost her family and home. Forced into the state foster care system, she has endured more grief, hardship, and legal problems. She has a significant distrust of authority and a strong desire for self-reliant independence. She has experienced great difficulty in adjusting to recent events and changes in her life. That same mistrust and stubbornness makes it hard for her to seek help. Counseling and recent confidence and understanding of her own abilities and mental state has begun to mitigate the trauma she has endured.

    ...

    She has straight, dark reddish brown hair with the hints of leftover red hair dye, brown eyes and light skin. She is 5’9” tall, and weighs around 175 lbs. She appears to be relatively fit and athletic. Although of mixed descent she considers herself Hispanic but is frequently mistaken for Caucasian.

    Her left lower leg bears burn scars. The nail of her first toe right foot is broken. Her left cheek is lightly scarred. Her left and right palms are mildly singed.

    Currently Feeling: Sullen, Depressed, Reckless, Traumatized, Grieving, Very Stressed

    Known Status Effects:
    Mental: Depression, Adjustment Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Aqua-phobia, Very Stressed, Conflict Seeking
    Physical: Scarred, Very Tense.



I cringed at the mention of the Chupacabra’s name in one of my windows, but was over that now, did my power know that? There are some minor changes, but still a lot of question marks obscuring numbers. How the hell does she weigh more than me and look like that? How did she go up a level? Do other people do that in general? Well of course they do. They have to, or I'd not be seeing infants at level 0, kids at 1-5, preteens and teenagers at 6-8 and most adults around 9-15. At least 15 is the top level I can see at the moment. What does Conflict Seeking mean? What does 'recent confidence and understanding of her abilities and mental state' supposed to mean?

I dove into a chain of Parapedia Observes to get more details. Depression, Adjustment Disorder, PTSD, Aqua-phobia were pretty straightforward. Very Stressed: ‘A condition between Stressed and Extremely Stressed when Stress points range from 51-76, it imparts negative modifiers to INT, WIS, and CHA.’ Yes I remember having that one. All the mental status effect usually gave related stat penalties, or they did to me. Since I can’t see the stats number on other people, (yet?) I have to assume they do the same… blah, blah… clinical definition of stress.

There was a range. I remember going through all of them. Stressed: 76-100, Very Stressed: 51-75, Extremely Stressed: 26-50, I remember Julia being at this level the last time I observed her. Near your Breaking Point: 1-26, Mental Breakdown: 0. So can I tell what peoples Stress points range is by seeing this status effect? I remember something about Mental Breakdown, buried in my old notifications history, where is that?

“Simon its time to go to the counseling sessions. Get ready and get in the car.”

Mrs. Beckett interrupted my search. I grabbed a snack, put the desiccant into the rice bag with the cell phones and went to the car. I could look at this on the drive over.

I kept an eye on Julia on the drive over. I had not closed her Observe window. Sullen was quite the apt descriptor for her apparent mood. Here they are, it was the fourth notification I ever received.

You are suffering from the Status Effect ‘Mental Breakdown’
…
You are suffering from the Status Effect ‘Drowning’
You are no longer suffering from the Status Effect ‘Drowning’
You have recovered 6 Stress points
The Status Effect ‘Mental Breakdown’ has been downgraded to ‘Near your breaking point’

The three preceding notifications were for gaining my three Gamer skills: Mind, Body, Interface. The 42nd notification was when I was fucking drowning in that sink hole. All of those have the same exact timestamp. No longer drowning, the stress point recovery, and getting downgraded to ‘Near your breaking point’ all occur simultaneously a moment later.

That was my trigger event wasn’t it? Down to the exact date, hour, minute and second on those 42 simultaneous time stamps, when my Stress Points hit 0. Does that mean…does that mean I can tell how close someone might be to being on the receiving end of a trigger event by using observe and viewing their stress status effects? Shit if that’s true, I wouldn’t want to know.

Your Parahuman Lore skill has increased by 1

Really? Fuck you troll. Hmm didn’t stop at exactly 0.00%, no specialties for that skill?

Stress points are not on a 100 points scale though I have a max of 350, which I think, is just INT + WIS times 10. What the hell happens to people with really crappy stats? Like a 5 in each? Are they always stressed or do they have an ‘Ignorance is Bliss’ situation going on or are stats that low just rare?

I’m losing focus. Sullen, Depressed, Traumatized, Grieving, there was nothing unexpected Observe was telling me there. Scarred: ‘A permanent effect reducing Allure due to scars from injuries marring a person’s appearance. Reduction amount is dependent on severity, visibility, and opinion of viewer(s)’. Reckless: ‘Willing and desires to engage in dangerous acts, while ignoring concerns for the safety of her own life, due to not caring if she perishes as a result of the consequences.’ combined with Conflict Seeking: ‘Influenced by forces to search for and pursue conflict and the experiences and data such an encounter provides. While informative and can drive one to advance one’s skills and abilities, it is just as equally dangerous given the risk of host death,’ looks like a recipe for disaster. Also forces? Host? Parapedia would not delve further onto those subjects.

At the counseling sessions, there was more group therapy, more exposure therapy, and more one-on-one stuff. I got gains in Empathy and Psychology, and stress points and minor gains in Gamer’s Mind, but enough to top me over a level. Subsequent Observes on Julia didn’t reveal new changes. Everybody (except me) had the ‘Stressed’ status effects, among other things. Janet was actually worse than Julia, she was still in the ‘Extremely Stressed’ bracket. I had not paid close attention to what she had previously, but maybe I should.

Good news is that the counselor guy thinks I can switch to once a week. However I said I’d like to keep more frequent times, especially if it can in any way help the others during group. Also if it keeps recovering my stress points, I don’t want that to stop. Julia was present, but didn’t participate in the group session today. That should probably be a goal in regards to the ‘Help Julia Recover’ quest. What explicitly can help her recover stress points, mechanically speaking? Unfortunately one thing that would probably do the opposite, is busting out the Parahuman talk like I had originally wanted to do.

When we got back, I had stupid punishment chores, but that got me piddling XP quests so no big deal. I kept an eye on Julia to see if there was a chance to talk but she got right back on the house phone again. Some scrying/free camera and volume setting tweaks let me eavesdrop. She was calling dozens of funeral homes and related facilities, as well as CPS, parent’s insurance companies, credit card companies to halt charges, and her state trust manager to try and get emergency money released to pay for stuff. I started to feel really creepy so I left her alone.

I was able to try and copy the data of the sim cards with the reader I got onto the computer. Because the format of the one was so old though I would have to do more research to know understand what the file format was, or find some program that could read it. Her sister’s data might be easier if Julia can just swap the sims into hers. Looking all the shit up though took the whole evening, I’d have to talk to her about it tomorrow.

I had reawakened my Golem and let it stay like that while I meditated for a couple hours, I also wanted to see what would happen if I kept it awake, hidden in my backpack, without any commands, while I was sleeping. While meditating did not even come close to offsetting the 3 MP per minute cost of the active golem, sleeping should still give me a net positive MP gain, even if it meant waking up with far less than max mana.

Saturday, January 9th, 2010

Woke up at 5 am with 354 MP, about what I had pre-calculated. The Golem was still active, but I didn’t want it draining everything off me, so I immediately put it back to sleep. That’s good. It means I can have a guard when I am sleeping. Skill gain for merely having the Golem awake is pretty damn slow, but it’s pretty much free skill XP, since I don’t have to do anything. Oh! I could easily make this a 7th simultaneously practiced skill if I did the same thing as I did before. Since creating just one Golem brought me evenly from level 1 to 2, I guess making them is the far faster skill gain method. But if I want one that isn’t completely crappy, I have to do a much better job at it.

I used stealth for practice and snuck over to the computer, got on and started doing my research. Some twenty minutes later a sleepy Mrs. Beckett poked her head around the corner of the stairwell.

“I need my pain pills”. She just left without saying anything this time, I activated free camera and she came back later and put the bottle on the desk and left again. Oh well not my fault if she forgot to take the bottle back when I was done. I was pretty sure I could get into the safe if I wanted to now anyway (though getting caught was a separate question.)

By the call for breakfast I had found a program to use and gotten access to one set of the sim data. Julia came down and made herself another gigantic bowl of cereal, and huge glass of milk. Janet was staring vacantly, ignoring the eggs she was making until they almost burned. Mrs. Beckett took over, and told her to sit down.

“I got the data recovered from one phone and onto the computer upstairs. The other you might be able to get by swapping sim and memory cards, assuming they have dried out okay.” I told Julia during a lull in the table chatter.

“Rhrmm?” She garbled a surprise through a mouthful of cereal. “Really?” she said again after swallowing.

“Yeah, I can show you after breakfast. How are you holding up?”

Julia eked out a mournful sigh, and spoke slowly between mouthfuls. “I don’t know. Memorial and funeral service thing is tomorrow.”

“So soon?”

“Has to be…so many are gone, took forever to find a place.”

“Do you want me to come?”

She shrugged. “It’s far, like nearly an hour’s drive out. Closest location with space, for one.”

For one casket or one plot was left unsaid. “I don’t mind whatever distance or time that involves. I just wanted to lend my support.”

“Thanks” Julia said as she finished off the last of her cereal.

“At least there is something for you to bury.” Janet said as she got up and walked off. I threw and Observe at her as she went away. Still ‘Extremely Stressed’, among other things. Julia made an angry grimace at her as she left, and then got up to make a plate of eggs. Is the depression making her eat more?

I read all of Janet’s Observe info. “She’s hurting just as much, with more stress and lashing out. She’ll be 18 in the summer, and age out of the foster care system, and be entirely on her own.”

“Doesn’t make me feel any better.”

“Wasn’t supposed to, but at least I am glad I have a place to sleep, as stupid as all their rules are.”

“Maybe, I’d rather be on my own.”

“You ready to look at the data yet?”

“Not sure. Did you look at any of it?”

“Only enough to verify it was readable. Contact list, text history, phone photos. Haven’t looked at your sister’s. Wanted to try the card swap first.”

“Alright.” We finished eating and I retrieved the Ziploc bag that held her sister’s phones, sim and memory card, rice and desiccant, and we trudged upstairs. I pulled them out and handed the sim and card to her.

“What happened to the case?” Julia asked.

“I’m sorry, I hope you didn’t want to keep it, It was, falling apart, and smelled really bad.”

She sighed at me again. “Show me what to do.”

I showed her how to swap sim cards, and soon her phone was up with all her sister’s contact, photos and history. I also showed her how to go through her Dad’s phone data that I had gotten onto the computer.

“You should probably write all the contacts info down on paper or something. Put the photos on a USB stick or such; though still keep the cards and things anyway.” I mentioned some minutes later after giving her a bit of privacy.

“Thanks, a lot, really. I had no idea how I was going to reach any of their friends or even some of my extended family… to let them know what happen. It means a lot to me.”

A broken smartphone… was that my question mark reward? Gee, way to be obvious. “What do you want to do with your sister’s phone?”

“Does it work at all?”

“I don’t know. I dried it out, but can’t tell unless we turn it on.”

“Do you need the cards back to do that?”

“No”

“Go ahead and try then”

I put its battery back in and tried to power it up, but it wouldn’t turn on. “Nope, but battery might have no charge.”

“Let me see the battery.” I took the battery back out and handed it to her. She turned away and did something with her own phone. “Battery is dead.” She said as she handed it back to me.

She seemed rather sure. I whispered ‘observe’ to check the battery. I should have done that earlier. Not only was it without charge but Observe indicated it was out right non-functional. “How did you know it was dead?”

“Oh...just guessing really. Hey we can try the battery from mine. They are the same phone. You do it though.” Julia turned her phone off and handed it to me, then turned back to the computer to look through the data from her dad’s phone.

I took hers out and put it into the dead phone and powered it up. Amazingly it came to life, only to show some error messages on an entirely non-responsive screen. “Oh well good and bad news. It works and powers up, but there is an error and the screen won’t respond. ‘SIM card not detected’ well duh, and ‘Input interface not detected’.”

“So it’s broken?”

“Yeah, it’s borked.”

“Can you fix it?”

“I don’t know. Depends on what is wrong, and even then It would probably have to be taken to some repair place somewhere.”

“If you think you can fix it I’ll sell it to you.”

“Really? Are you sure? It was your sister’s phone.”

“Not the cards. It’s identical to mine anyway. So long as I have the data, that’s what matters. I need the money.”

“Hmm well when we were on the island in those stores, you could have...”

“Yeah, I could have, probably should have with you, but I didn’t.”

“Okay, though don’t know what it will cost to fix it, and get a new battery.”

“Yeah, well I need my battery back. I have to make a bunch of difficult phone calls.”

“Do you have service again? I thought it was suspended.” I asked as I handed the battery back to her.

“No service yet, I have to use the landline. I still need to sign up for a prepaid account on my phone and buy minutes. That’s why I need money.”

I’d probably need to do that too. Maybe I shouldn’t have bought that MP3 player. “Can I still look over it, to see what might be wrong, or at least take it to a repair shop to see if it is savable and how much it would cost?”

Julia nodded, and went downstairs with her phone and the paper pad she wrote in, leaving her sister’s broken phone with me. I realized I kinda had no real idea what I was doing though. Recovering data off sim and memory cards was one thing, actually fixing the hardware was another and beyond my knowledge. But did it have to be? Observe was pretty powerful, it told me exactly why the battery was dead. Maybe I could use it on the individual components?

I spent a couple hours researching the specs and internals of the phone on the computer, and then had to bug the Beckett’s to open the office to get a printout of it all, because other people wanted to use the computer. I was tempted to just pick the lock again, but too many people about. I’d have much rather just got to a repair shop, as I had looked up several of them, but was ‘grounded’ because I didn’t ask for permission to walk to the damn stores and such yesterday.

It was still progress. Researching the smart phone was gaining my computers skill anyway, as was opening it up with the toolkits I bought. Abusing my micro-vision camera zoom-in cheat, I was able to use Observe on every single component and every single connector, resistor and circuit, thoroughly inspecting each one. Through that I was grinding both Observe and Gamer’s Interface. Though, the latter was getting noticeably more difficult. Apparently all the component parts and circuitry and such still counted as small or mundane objects because it only cost 2 MP for each use of Observe. I only need to look at a few hundred of them.

For testing and training your senses, you have gained 1 PER.

Yeah, awesome, by a bit past noon, and 420 something uses of Observe via micro-vision later, I had gained a ‘Smartphones’ specialty for the Computers skill and was close to leveling Observe again. But I was also nearly out of mana. I won’t be getting another specialty in Computers next level because I had to keep going on the smartphone stuff to verify that what I had found was the only issue that was wrong with it. Using Micro-vision, I did find a few more tiny water drops that I removed with a suction micro-pipette that came with the toolkit, as well as specks of dirt grains with some magnifying tweezers.

The problem with the phone was that one tiny component that had been shorted-out from water damage. Its job (according to the helpfully descriptive Observe info) was to receive all the touch screen inputs and send them on their way to the main board. So while we could see the screen and touch the screen, the computer inside wasn’t getting anything. It was kind of like if the mouse/keyboard I/O controller wasn’t working on a PC motherboard. Now the issue is that I have no idea how that is fixed or replaced. At least I got the part number info. I’ll have to try calling the various repair shops in the area. A quick scry told me Julia was still on the phone, so I’ll have to wait until it is free.

****​

Lunch had come and gone. Julia had to go off and attend her anti-youth violence class thing due to her plea. You would think they would give a reprieve or something given the situation but apparently not. At least I managed to call around or email a few phone repair shops. If I can get the phone repaired it would be way cheaper than trying to buy a new one. Hopefully it will satisfy that 'get a smartphone quest.'

No TV, not that I cared, could not go out, grounded, the other kids were using the computer, and Julia would be gone for several hours. That left me with little options for what do, so I spend the whole afternoon and into the evening reading the Earth Science book. I wonder if I was going to get some other skill and free specialty like I did with Mathematics? Should I take it this time? I suppose this time around I can use Parapedia on gain more insights on what future skills might be capable of.

I got ‘All Weather Friend’ as my feature from reaching Gamer’s Body level 10 from getting to level 7 earlier today. Seems I can now ignore non-damaging temperature effects? No more ‘Chilled’ status effects? Also, I think I can safely confirm that features get unlocked at level 5 and 10. A third feature must unlock at level 20 – 25. Since Gamer’s Interface is at a 19, and I have not yet had other features unlock for it since the ‘Notes and keyboard interface’ thing.

I’ve been sorely tempted to use those unspent skill points on it to see. I still remember that message about the Inventory feature not being unlocked yet. While it might be some other skill or perk that grants it, Interface seems the most likely bet. Issue is that, in the long run, using those skill points on the Gamer skills would be a waste, since they auto-increment each level up. They’ll be maxed out on their own in due time.

Julia and Mrs. Beckett weren’t back yet by dinner. Rachel had to help with dinner, lasagna. Some compliments on it, earn a relationship point. Conversation was on first day of school for us, myself Rachel, Janet and Julia come Monday. For the rest of the kids it was just the end of winter break. I didn’t know what my schedule would be none of us did, though being in different (except for Julia and me) it would probably be varied. Mrs. Pearson is going to go with us to school Monday and get various stuff sorted out. Hopefully I can get into some of Julia’s classes. The other kids say it is an A day B day type schedules. I sure Math, English and Science will be unavoidable, but it leaves five other classes. The other kids say they have Art, and Computer Science (although nobody in the house is taking it). We still would have to go to counseling after school Monday anyway.

I went back to my reading after dinner. When Mrs. Beckett and Julia got home later, neither was much for talking. Julia scarfed down the leftovers and an Observe said she was currently feeling: ‘Pissed the Fuck Off’, among her other usual flavors. I didn’t think it was a good idea to ask, and we didn’t get to talk anymore today.

I tucked in early at 9 to grind a few hours of meditation before preparing to for my 5 hour sleep at midnight. There probably wasn’t anything (or anyone) left in this house, or neighbors houses, or even on my interface left to grind Observe to get decent XP gain on without just wasting MP. I reactivated Spider-Bong so I could grind my Golem skill while I slept and not waste any mana.

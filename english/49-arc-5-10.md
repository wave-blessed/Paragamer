Stage 4: Arrivals & Departures Arc 5.10

Saturday March 6th, 2010

My arm is itching me really badly. Stupid festering wound. The status effect still says 64 plus days, so why did Blasto tell me it would clear up in a few weeks? That’s not a few weeks that’s over two months. He would have had no reason to lie either, he didn’t even think I would remember the conversation! Is he simply wrong? What is he basing that on anyway? Did this Butcher hit me with a worse version or did it interact weirdly with my powers?

I stop walking, I’m finally in front of Julia’s address. All this time, all this shit I went through to get here. Do I look presentable? Do I *sniff* …

Damn, I haven’t showered since DC! That was some days ago and I‘ve been in two fights and woke up face down in an alley with my clothes stripped… and, I don’t even have a mirror. Is my hair messed up? Of all the damn things to forget to put into my inventory! I forgot to put in a mirror! That’s the only way I can use Observe on myself, I haven’t even checked to see if my age changed to find out if it was my birthday. Damn it, I don’t even have a comb in my inventory either! I got days’ worth of food, camping gear, tools, clothes, guns, and miscellaneous crap, but no comb or mirror!

Should I go or should I clean up first? Where? Where the hell am I going to do that? Fuck it…

I ring the doorbell, but no sound emits. Observe. It’s broken.

I knock on the rusty wrought iron storm door. It made an unpleasant clatter as red flakes fell away. I could just remote camera in there to check, but maybe that’s going too far...

Okay, it’s been a minute now. I knock again and cause more flakes to fall.

Another couple of minutes pass by. Okay fine, Free camera.

I send my view through the door, into a living room that looks three decades out of style. I explore a kitchen with a tiny table and a sink overflowing with dishes. Not exactly a tidy place here, I come back around through the hall, and into the downstairs master bedroom. It looks even more out of style than the living room. Ahhh!! Granny panties. Definitely not Julia’s room. I send my view back through the living room and up some stairs with a worn-out banister. I zoom through the dingy hallway, go through a bedroom door to find it filled with towering boxes of crap, and head back out again. I go across the hall into the other bedroom.

A desk with a loose hard-drive, schoolbooks, rumpled bed, girl’s clothing strewn all over it and the floor… An electronics’ book, wire, a voltmeter? Is she a tinker? Well, enough Observes indicated it was definitely her room, it’s just that nobody is home right now.

Well damn. All this way and they aren’t here. I switch back to normal camera mode.

Now what? I look around the neighborhood at run-down houses and unkempt yards. It would be kinda creepy to wait here on their porch. I see a charred house down the street with some broken caution tape around it and wander over. I wonder what happened here?

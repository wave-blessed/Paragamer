Well it’s new year’s eve. Actually not anymore as it done come and gone. I’m typing this up well after midnight into thin air in my bunk via the light of my interface. I stated my attempt at gaining a specialty in Observe today. I am restricting myself to only observing objects, non-living, inanimate stuff. It’s boring as hell, and my power gives me rude and snarky comments, but am I making progress. I am even skipping stuff like plants, and electronics, or anything that might be ‘complex’. I am going into this a bit blind sense I have no real idea if it will even work or what will count as a specialty.

Other skill progress was in Drug resist form my pain meds, but it is slowing down a lot. New fun fact, I’m not allowed to keep the pill on my person, even though I have a legit prescription. The Beckett’s put them into the safe they have in their office. I had to ask them each time I need one.

I also made progress in computers after setting up a bunch of torrents. Still need to hack the router and other computers though. Although I am apparently not allowed to use bribery to get a girl to go out with me, there were no such restrictions on using bribery to gain positive relationship points by download some of the others kids favorite songs and giving them copies. Doing that gave put Janet and Melissa enough of a bump to qualify for the quest. (Rachel too but she had already been gained.) I even got 1 point from Julia for finding songs by her favorite band. Points are a lot harder to gain though the higher the value is.

Beyond that I (and us as a group) had our first counseling session today. It was helpful, but mostly introductory. I got some gains in Empathy, Psychology and a little bit in Gamer’s Mind. The big win though was in stress points, a whole 10 for the session puts me a 99 now.

Julia did show up to the group therapy session later (she was late) but it was because she had been at her hearing. She ended up taking the plea. Now she is on probation, and has to do community service starting tomorrow and this weekend. Her gun got turned over to the social worker, who is keeping it a safe in her office with other stuff.

We did get to stay up late to past midnight because it was new year’s. Big woop. I got a new quest though, “Kiss someone at midnight”. My inquiries lost me some relationship points, got laughs from others, hit in the face with a pillow, and an offer of getting paid $20 from Rachel if I kissed Thomas. Technically my quest did not specify gender. Yeah nope, I failed that quest.

I did get a couple other very minor quests, ‘doing chores’ why didn’t I get them before now? Not like this was the first time I did chores here. Whatever, XP is XP, even if it’s a pittance. We lost power again sometime shortly after midnight. Dunno what is with that, Mrs. Beckett keeps yelling at the girls and complaining about hair dryers or something, though they all denied it. Player poker with my roommates, cheated, made a bit of money back before they gave up on me. Now I am going ot meditate for a bit before going to sleep.

Everyone has the day off though most places are also closed. Julia is out on community service picking up trash from last night’s revelers. I spent all day grinding observe, and grabbing more torrents (and XP in Computers) once word spread to the rest of the kids. Everyone is above stranger now except Thomas and Cody. Since Thomas already qualifies only Cody remains to complete the ‘Don’t be a stranger’ quest. Being friendly has not worked all that well, and he didn’t care about music so not sure what to do.

I doubled up on my pain meds, just to make Drug Resist get better gains. Sure, maybe not the smartest thing to do. I felt loopy only briefly then I was fine. It’s too damn slow otherwise.

I spent the rest of the day working on the Geometry book. That is giving me some slow gains in Basic Academics, but best of all I got another INT point. Instant increase to my mana, and another +10 stress points. That put me over 100, and my ‘Stressed’ status effect went away. Is 100 the boundary for that? Probably, my power likes to use significant numbers for stuff like that.

Also after gaining that INT point, I finally took the perk ‘Mana Reserve’ because the only way I can grind Observe faster is to have a larger Mana pool. I was not sure if it was retroactive or not until I took it. It was retroactive. While that is good, it also means I could have waited to take it. it gives a flat 25% bonus to mana points per level. I’ve derived that Max Mana equals (INT * Level * 10) * (1.25 for Mana Reserve)

Max regen seems to want to keep a minimum gain rate based on a percentage of your max mana, so higher max mana, also increased the regen rate by a corresponding amount.

Played poker again tonight, didn’t cheat this time as I think it might preventing gains in Luck. Lost some money, roommates are a bit happier. Cody still won’t play, or doesn’t have money. An offer to play for fun was turned down, so was an offer to teach him how to play. I keep saying no to the Card Games skill, I just don’t see it being a useful thing to keep in the long run.

Going to practice meditating again before I go to sleep, it is making slow but steady progress.

More grinding Observe today, I hit the next level and I was right. I Got ‘Captain Obvious’ as a specialty choice. I took it. What did it do? No damn idea. It’s probably just my power trolling me. I can’t observe another inanimate object to find out what benefit it might give, because doing so might cross contaminate my progress toward a different specialty. I am aiming to restrict my Observes entirely to people for the next level now to see what happens.

Doubled up on pain pills again to maintain Drug Resist gains, but am running out now. I have a doctors apt on the 4th, so make I can get a refill.

Got to go to a store today, picked up some padlocks to practice lock-picking on. Julia’s out on community service again. The Beckett’s said we would all be going to the mall again tomorrow, a different one this time.

I spend the rest of the day getting through the geometry book. Other kids think I am weird for that. I got barely a trickle for gains to Basic Academics; want to finish that quest though.

Third night in row a circuit breaker has tripped in the house. Mr. Beckett is getting pissed, and thinks it is a wiring issue, starting getting out his kit of stuff to inspect things.

Thomas dropped out of poker after losing tonight. Didn’t even cheat this time, and got another +1 LUC. I won’t be able to spent as much time meditating tonight because I spent a good bit of that time grinding Lockpicking on the padlocks I bought by the light of my interface window. Also forces me to learn to do it quietly.

Sunday January 3rd, 2010

This morning, I got to level 8 in Observe, but nothing. No specialty offer. Don’t know what happen, probably fucked it up somehow. I know I only used Observe on people, and once on myself in the mirror again. Did that one time mess it up? Well that pissed me off, because I have to either start over or pick something different, yet unique enough, and be consistent the whole time. I was about ready to give up, but on a lark I used Observe on the word ‘Specialty’ on my Observe skill descriptor and got a new window of info. Must have discovered the secret help guide, because damn. Gaining specialties did work about like how I suspected them, I just wished it gave me a list of actual examples. I used it on ‘Captain Obvious’ next. Apparently it means “Using observe on mundane objects (tinker tech not included) costs one less mana, and provide additional info such as item HP and damage resistance and reductions.’ I started using observe on all kinds of interface stuff from then on. It still costs me 3 MP per use though, guess my interface windows are not ‘mundane objects’. Though even better, I am grinding Gamer’s Interface at the same time as I use Observe on my Gamer’s Interface, so that’s cool.

Running low on the pain pills now, of course doubling is dwindling them faster, got my 4th level though this morning, but it is slowing down again.

We finally went back to the mall again today. It had taken a lot of cajoling, persuasion and convinced the other kids (not difficult) to keep asking; that got me another skill level in speech. We waited until Julia got back from doing the last 4 of her 20 hours of community service. She still has to attend some youth anti-crime and violence seminar thing next Saturday though.

We were at the mall for more clothes and school supply stuff. I finally got a good relationship bump to Cody, just needed to figure out what bribe to use. It became obvious when he was staring lustfully at the Sports Illustrated 2017 Swimsuit/Super-Heroine calendar. ‘Featuring Gravina: Get down under with this Australian Hottie. She puts the Super in supermodel. See her defy gravity in more ways than one!’ The innuendo was pretty blatant. Anyway, I bought it for him, and then helped him hide it because he was afraid the Beckett’s would take it. They probably would too. We had to cut out the pictures and hide them among pages of his new notebooks and school supply stuff. As if he was gonna be using the actual calendar part of it.

Well that bit let me complete the ‘Don’t be a Stranger’ quest, also apparently the relationship improvement or the speech training or whatever got me a point of CHA too. So that’s one more checkbox off the ‘Path to Min-Maxing’ quest too. Training CON is now the only one left.

Then, off to the arcade. I asked Julia but she said she wasn’t ready for that yet. Stupid me, figured she might be interested because that was where I first saw her in Galveston, but that was also where she was at when things went to shit.

Well they had same dancing game, and I was right, got a ‘dancing’ specialty under athletics. They also had a canoeing and a cycling game which earned me specialties in those. They had a golfing game too, but I didn’t see the point in it. I was not planning on being late like last time. I picked up ‘sub-machine guns’ and ‘lasers’ due to some weird alien shooter, as specialties under firearms too. I wish I could find a shooter that used rifles, I know they exist, but don’t know where to find one. Also want to find one of those virtual fighter/boxing games. Not a joystick/button masher, those don’t seem to work; but one of those motion capture or pad-puncher ones. Maybe one those will gain me a skill.

When I got home, screwing around dribbling a basketball and make several one handed shots at the hoop (missing each time) got me a ‘Basketball’ specialty in athletics. As before though, I stopped immediately after getting it.

I got Julia to teach me some Spanish, enough to gain a skill in it. I lied a bit though implying that I thought I knew it before and was just remembering now. That was to cover up any rapid gains, Observing the skill (and English) told me it only had a MAX skill level of 5. So that can’t take too long to gain, unless it is proportional to max level. Other Skills max out at 100, except Gamer’s Body, Mind and Interface, which MAX at 25. I think those are special cases though.

After that I worked more on the geometry book, I was nearly done with that, that will be another quest completed when I do. Now I just finished grinding lockpicking in bed again, padlocks are not gaining any more. My skill hit another barrier at level 5. No specialties though, some skills have them, some skills don’t. That was something else I learned by using Observe on interface elements. Since I am stuck with lock-picking, it leaves me with about an hour of meditation practice before sleeping. I should go to the hardware store again, return the padlocks and get something different to see if that helps.

Finally saw a doctor today and got all my stitches removed, and got my cast replaced with a less restricting one. The swap out didn’t affect my stat penalties from broken arm though. Although the penalties have been shrinking over time on their own, the Feb 1st timer deadline hasn’t changed. I used the last of my old bottle of pain pills this morning, tripled for the gains. Some successful speech checks and overt complaining got me a stronger prescription, or so he says, he seems rather reluctant to write the prescription. It’s only 30 days’ worth though. Also got him to prescribe some physical therapy, but not sure how that will go since my later inquiry tells me insurance doesn’t cover it.

Hell I didn’t even know I had insurance, and apparently there is an issue with it still because of my lack of formal ID. I thought Medicaid was for old people? We had to go clear across town because a lot of docs wouldn’t take it, though apparently CPS and the Beckett’s had gone through this enough times in the past to know who to visit.

I had another individual and group therapy counseling session today. There will be more on Wednesday and Friday, and then we change schedules next week to accommodate school hours. I got more gains in Empathy, Psychology, Gamer’s Mind, and stress points again. Bit slower this time, except for the stress points. Learned about ‘exposure therapy’ to help Julia and me handle our aqua-phobia issues, and even just being able to see pictures, or even video of the aquatic chupacabra , without having an anxiety attack. I’ve been told I have been making record progress, but that is because Gamer’s Mind lets me cheat at it, the others don’t have that luxury. It also means I can keep training Gamer’s Mind in tiny bits, by actually preparing myself and forcing myself to watch the crap on the computer or such. Maybe it will work for similar stuff? Could I gain skill by watching horror and disaster movies? I’ll have to give some a try to see. Both of those genres are very much not all that popular anymore for obvious reasons, but there are some pre-scion ones out there.

I finally got a bag of clay from a craft store. Still haven’t made a golem yet, because I want to do that somewhere private. I did try plain old dirt and mud before going to the store, but it didn’t work. Maybe there wasn’t enough clay in it? Too dirty or contaminated? I don’t know, so I hope this will be enough. The Beckett’s know I have the clay, I said it was art therapy and I wanted to take art classes once I got to school. They end up getting to ‘know’ almost all purchases. Between holding money for us, doling out approved purchases related to qualifying child care expenses, and having an inventory of our possessions, hiding shit is not easy. How in the hell would I hide a costume or anything else I might find I need to become a cape? The answer is probably inventory, which I still can’t access yet. It’s related to the Interface skill though, so gotta keep grinding that one.

As such, I have been doing exactly that, mainly via using Observe on my interface keep gaining on that too. Which worked, I got a ‘Parapedia’ specialty for observe. I took it, but now I’m in a dilemma. It took 750 successful uses (2250 MP minimum) to gain the specialty. (Going from level 8 to 9 and dropping). If I use observe to find out what Parapedia does, that is a use on the interface and not on whatever I want to try and specialize in next, which means I won’t gain a specialty at level 9 and drop to 8. I’ll just stay at level 9, and have to attempt the level 9 to 10 jump to try for a specialty there. If my calcs are correct, that would be a minimum of another 850 uses or 2550 MP. It gets worse every time. I want to try to do people again, since that is what I see happening most often in the future. But restrict myself to people to gain the specialty, and I restrict myself from using observe on all other kinds of stuff I might need to later. This makes gaining those specialties at low levels even more important than I thought before. Given how useful observe has proven to be, I will be hard pressed to not want to use it on all kinds of things, which makes pursuing specialties on it a significant self-imposed limitation.

So despite the restriction I have to try now rather than later. So I am aiming for observing people only. This time I am excluding myself (and Julia, just in case) and in general only going to use it on people whose tags show they are level 10 or lower. Incidentally, overhead tags show Julia as level 12 and Mr. Beckett as level 13, which if my estimates are correct is currently the highest level I can detect.

Also had another appointment with Mrs. Pearson, it was mostly about school preparation. She still has not had any luck in finding any verifiable ID for me. She did find Jerry Mondale but he had apparently killed himself over grief. I’m not sure what I am supposed to feel about that, I didn’t know him apart from that one encounter. It was unlikely there was anything more information he could provide anyway, other than confirming he was a history teacher in Galveston. Apparently he didn’t have to be alive for Mrs. Pearson to get that verified.

I finished getting through Julia’s Geometry textbook this evening. Basic Academics had gotten to 9 and then I stopped gaining points in it yesterday, but I still wanted to finish that quest. When I did, I got to have ‘Mathematics’ as a skill, with a free specialty in ‘Geometry’. Mathematics is pretty broadly defined, but then again so was ‘Basic Academics’. Of course I can’t use Observe on it yet to know more, since I already started pursuing some kind of observing people specialty. I took it anyway, ought to be useful for school and stuff.

As soon as I did so, I got a near identical quest for ‘Know the Earth’ basically to go through the Earth Science textbook also just like a had the Geometry one. Difference was that the time limit was simply ‘1 month’ instead of before school starts.

I’ll meditate again tonight before sleep. I have that Eye Doctor appointment tomorrow. I don’t know how that is going to turn out since suddenly not actually needing glasses anymore. Should I fake it? Who pays for the prescription anyway? Well time to pester the Beckett’s about my pain meds. I figure if I pester them often enough really persistently at inopportune times they will give up trying to keep the damn things in a safe and just let me keep them. Then again I do get to practice using scrying to view the combination to that thing each time I get them to open it.

Well, I guess I am a deceptive little snit aren’t I? After convincing the eye doctor I did need glasses by lying on my eye chart and crap he wrote a prescription. Then, since the Beckett’s were cheap, they brought me to the Costco close to the house to get the prescription, that part was on them. Later on I walked back to Costco, after making a photo-copy of the receipt, returned them and said it was the wrong prescription, and asked for store credit so I could use it on the correct one. That of course never happened. I used my store credit to visa gift card, and I used that to buy some very cheap non-prescription glasses with the same kind of frames, and pocketed the rest. Apparently this bit of activity earned me a ‘deception’ specialty for speech.

I hadn’t realized I had been using it in that way that much. Speech is an active skill, but have I been consciously or unconsciously using it thus far? When I used Observe on ‘Active’ previously it has said it meant it required an explicit action or conscious choice. So I guess I had been using it consciously but had not realized it? Perhaps it means it will be easier to gain specialties in it if I can choose not to use the skill when doing persuasive or deceptive things when I am trying to gain a different specialty? What other speech specialties might there be? Streetwise? Barter? Intimidation? Debate?

It’s a thought for later. I had also got the Beckett’s to let me go to a gym down the street since the doctor had prescribed me physical therapy, even if it wasn’t going to get covered. They wouldn’t pay for gym membership either but I printed up a trail membership coupon. So when I went there, I went to Costco instead. Then I went to the hardware store again and exchanged the key pad-locks for combination padlocks. Then I finally went to the gym.

My goal at the Gym was to try and get part of that ‘path to the cheese’ quest completed. Other attempts and simultaneously training skill had not gotten up to the minimum 5 so far. Julia let me borrow her MP3 player, and I had downloaded a learning Spanish audio book onto it. So now I was running on a treadmill while listening to that after taking a double dose of my stronger pain pills, while using Observe of every person I saw in the Gym.

I succeeded, trained Gamer’s Body by draining my stamina down to zero, and getting hit with negative status effects. Pills upped my drug and poison resistance skill, running trained athletics, and listening to the Spanish and using Observe got me the 5 I needed. I was only able to maintain it for about an hour, and stopped after I got the prompt for gaining a ‘running’ specialty for athletics. It didn’t trigger any stat training though; I was really hoping it would.

All that got me a level in Gamer’s Body and a level in Drug and Poison Resistance. That’s level 5 now, which unlocked a feature called ‘Drugs are bad. M’Kay?’ My power uses the weirdest names and phrases for things. The tooltip for it say ‘Except when they are good. Positive medically beneficial effects are retained’. The XP gain for the simultaneous skill achievement bumped me over level 6, so at least I was the same level of Joanna and Cody the 8th graders now. This in turn gained me a level up in Body, Mind and Interface. Still 8 levels short of 25 in Interface though.

I was totally exhausted when I got back to the Beckett’s house. At the rate of my stamina regen it would take over 5 hours to get back to maximum while awake. I really need to make more use of that gym, but I can barely even get a free day to make that damn golem. I have no idea how long it will take, and I need a day that isn’t overloaded with appointments or other trips and such, which hasn’t happened yet. Tomorrow is more counseling, as is Friday, and next Monday, school starts. The deadline for it though is the 12th. Maybe I can try this Thursday or this weekend if I can get out of the house.

Now that I can talk and meditate at the same time, I can whisper Observe while doing my scrying thing and pretending to sleep, or nap in this case, but only after I have positioned my camera. I needed new target to practice Observe on so I was scrying and using it on all the neighbors, until I exhausted all my targets. Then I had to push my camera as far as my range could so I can wait for cars stopping at a stop light and observe the drivers and passengers as they waited. Even then it was a bit far to view, and not enough cars came by at these hours. I was going to have wasted mana tonight.

Wednesday January 6th, 2010

It was more of the same again today. We had more group therapy appointments. I got slow skill gains, and even got an ‘Affective’ specialty for Empathy and a ‘Group Therapy’ one for Psychology.

Five more uses of observe on low level people and this time I finally did get another specialty, ‘People-Watcher’. I am not going for another specialty right now. If my suspicions are correct, then there might be one for Parahumans, but I’d also have to meet and use observe on 850+ Parahumans in person to get it, and never use observe for anything else in-between. I just don’t see that happening, ever. So now I can get back to using Observe unrestricted. Observe on the interface, and Parapedia and People-Watcher, just like Captain Obvious does let me gain a bit more info about those targets, and reducing the MP cost by -1. Apart from the reduced cost, great on its own, People-Watcher didn’t do much else that I could tell right now, besides include an Equipment list. However, I still had to Observe each individual piece of equipment (if it was visible) to get more than just a name out of it. Also, I found out I can use Observe on buildings. It tells me the number of floors, the address, number of occupants, and who the owner or owning company is, as well as a Faction tag, which so far has said nothing but ‘none’, just like most people.

Most significant in my discoveries, now that I have the People-Watcher specialty, all the kids, plus the Beckett’s, and the counseling staff, and everyone else I have used Observe on, it costs only 2 MP. Using Observe on me and Julia costs 3 MP. Given the rest of my suspicions, I think that is pretty strong proof. Maybe I can finally work up the nerve to ask her about it tomorrow. She seems to be doing a lot better, but is still an ‘acquaintance’ at 80 relationship points. I might have asked this evening but she had more community service to work through. Though, I would also still prefer to achieve that friend status first.

Since ‘running’ was a specialty, I suspected things like climbing, swimming, and such might be too. Climbing had to wait until my arm was better. Swimming I sure as hell was not ready for yet, nor was there a nearby pool to use. Plus it was January. I tried for jumping, as that was often a RPG skill. Yet after several running and leaping about, all I got nothing when hit level 2, so I stopped. I was probably because I fucked up again. Does it really have to be absolutely restricted to jumping or was that simply not a specialty that was offered? Walking clearly didn’t count or I would have it already, but taking running long jumps was gaining my athletics. Was it the running part? Maybe I need to get a jump-rope, but that also has to wait until my arm is better.

Well I could still try some other things. After grabbing some snacks to restore some HP I lost from banging my arm around while jumping, I went back to the gym. Same set up this time, but went with using the weight machines instead. Drugged up on a double dose, I worked Drug & Poison Resistance, Athletics, Gamer’s Body, listened to more of the learning Spanish audio books, and this time I used Observe on my interface stuff, to practice Gamer’s Interface as well. Success with 6 simultaneous skills for an extra +50 XP, and earned +1 Gamer’s Interface, +1 STR and +1 CON. The CON gave me another +50 XP, and I finally got that Min-Max quest to complete. How could I simultaneously train 7 or more skills? I think the CON gain though came mostly from the heavy stamina loss and occasional HP loss from banging my arm up. I kept going though only stopping when I got a ‘weight-lifting’ specialty for athletics.

Since I was not restricted in using Observe anymore, it was easier to use up a lot of my mana again making very steady progress, especially when all of it cost 2 MP instead of 3. I got up to level 9 easily. As soon as I reached that though, I switch to try a round of using Observe on buildings only since those still cost 3 MP, I hoped there was a specialty for them as well. That will be much more achievable than doing Parahumans. Using scrying while mediating to put my free camera in the air as high as possible tonight, allowed me to use Observe on a whole bunch of houses. All in all, great progress today. Though just like yesterday, I still did not succeed in picking the combination padlocks I bought. I’m going to have to research some clues online tomorrow.

There will be a lot to do tomorrow, make the golem so I have something to show Julia about my own powers if needed, and ask her about hers too.

I put Spider-Bong to sleep after I woke up. Hmm, might as well make that its official name. Can I change it? Yep, rename button on Golem Status screen. I wanted to try an experiment today. How far away can I be from the Golem and still sense my connection to it? So before we leave for the memorial service, I’ll wake him up and leave him at the house doing nothing. We’d be travelling a fair bit away so it would be a good test.

In hindsight I actually shouldn’t have put the golem to sleep yet. I was up early as usual, and should really strive to always be gaining in some kind of skill all the time. Right now keeping the Spider-Bong awake, and taking double pain pills for Drug resist, was the only skills I could gain wise while truly engaged in routine stuff like shower, getting ready in the morning, and so on. So not even 5 minutes later I woke it up again. I would not be able to keep it active all the time, but I had plenty of MP as a buffer. I just need to make sure I saved enough for using Observe when we get out of the house.

The Beckett’s didn’t bother me this time, so I read before during and after breakfast. For some reason though, Basic Academics was not rising with reading the Earth Science book, like it had for the Geometry book. I’ll still finish it for the XP though.

I wasn’t much for conversation, no one was. Small talk and not so small talk both seemed out of place given that we’d be going to a funeral. I hid Spider-Bong in a bag under a bush in the alley. Just in case something weird happens while it was awake and I got further away, like it would run to catch or up something, I didn’t want it to go careening through the house.

It only took a few minutes after driving out to lose my connection to Spider-Bong. It felt the same way it did when it went to sleep and I got a notification saying I had gone out of range. We were probably less than a quarter mile from the house. I noted the street and landmarks when it happened so I could try to get a more precise idea of the exact range when I could look it up later.

After that it was a lot of nothing. It was a lot easier to meditate during the car ride as it went smoothly down the highway as opposed to the bus stopping and starting at stops and in city traffic. It took a bit over an hour to get there. Wasn’t much to look at out here except plants and birds, so that’s what I found myself using Observe on.

It turns out both plants and animals (well birds, squirrels, and some insects) still cost 3 MP. Also, it does not appear that I get skill XP for using Observe on the same species, even if they were different critters or plants. Discovering that resulted in some wasted MP, not sure if that will still hold true for things like highly varied dog breeds or other such.

I threw an Observe at Julia again. Last night’s ‘Pissed the Fuck Off’ had simply turned into ‘Angry’ and ‘Somber’, with no notable skill XP gained. I kept grinding Observe on as many new things as I could throughout the services to get gains but probably still somehow wasted around 20% on duplications, or things my power didn’t consider unique enough to be rewarding.

The services themselves were at a tiny rural Catholic church a block from funeral home and cemetery. According to Observe the priest was young, inexperienced, and already run ragged from the fallout of the attack still affecting things even this far out into the South Texas rural areas. Was Julia Catholic or was this just the most convenient place to use?

Despite the rushed organization, and the inexperience of the priests, the serenity and genuineness of the setting and his words was comforting. I mentally substituted my friends and parents, even though I could not remember them, as being laid to rest, , and had more than one of my on suppressed emotional breaths. They were diminished in comparison to Julia’s own quiet sobs. I guess my power considered it cathartic enough, as a decent gain in stress points indicated. I hope the same was true for Julia, but if so, Observe on her didn’t indicate a change in her Stressed status effect, but only in her emotions.

Some young woman showed up late and attended the cemetery portion of the funeral service. Abusing my volume settings let me eavesdrop as she interacted with Julia. Seems her name was Cindy and apparently was Teresa’s dorm roommate at UT. She brought a car full of clothes and boxes of Teresa's stuff from the dorm. I helped load them all into our car once the services ended.

The mood was just as silent on the drive back, Julia did manage to eke out a quiet thanks to me, Rachel, and Mrs. Beckett for coming with her. She even hugged us; at least she did to Rachel. The one she gave me was more like awkwardly leaning on my clothes than a proper hug. That apparently earned me another +1 relationship point, but I was still 4 shy of 100. I meditated again in the car, and used more Observes via my camera modes as we rode home.

When we got back, I was at near zero mana. I stealthed around to the ally to see that Spider-Bong was still in the same place I left it. Wasn’t much unique left to Observe and I’d have to wait to build up MP to awaken Spider-Bong again later this evening anyway. I threw another Observe at Julia, who had gotten on the phone again. Nothing had changed, but I decided to keep the window open to see if anything new came about, and read the science book until dinner.

“Do you think we’ll have any classes together?” I asked Julia during dinner.

She paused mid bite to look up at me, and then continued taking her time chewing before finally making a non-committal shrug, so I went on.

“I guess we have to do all the placement tests tomorrow, though not sure if they’ll take all day. Don’t know what they’ll do with us afterward if school isn’t out yet.”

“Simon.” Julia responded looking at me with tired eyes. “I have to meet with Mrs. Pearson tomorrow. I won’t be at school.”

“Oh” Well fuck, when was I going to find a chance to try and ask her alone about whether or not she is a Parahuman, and show her Spider-Bong? Or is it too soon? I hope I’m not already pushing too much. “Will you be at the counseling session tomorrow afternoon?”

“I don’t know, maybe.”

“I’ve gotten better at Spanish, I think I knew it before, and am remembering it now. I found some audio lessons that helped also.”

“I know you forgot to delete them off my MP3 player.”

“Oh, sorry. Thanks for the lesson-reminders earlier, maybe taking it as a class will help more, unless you want to give another lesson…when you fell up to it.”

Julia only shrugged and continued eating.

“Well, I found some phone repair shops, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to visit them tomorrow with school and the counseling session thing, they’ll probably be closed by the time all that is done with.”

“You won’t be going out to any stores or shops Simon.” Mr. Beckett announced diverting from his own side conversation and butting into ours. “We haven’t forgotten you leaving without permission the other day.”

“Is there ever going to be a time when you do give ‘permission’? If not, then what’s the point of asking?” I blurted out, my annoyance getting the better of me.

“We’ll discuss that when it arises, right now you need to just focus on getting settled into school next week.” Mr. Beckett retorted.

“Besides, we only have two cars, and Richard uses his for work.” Mrs. Beckett added in. “There is only so much time that can be devoted to shuttling everyone in the house around for necessary activities.”

“I know how to use the buses; I did so, and returned in time, without affecting anyone’s schedules or making you use your minivan for anything. So talking about your limited taxi ability is not a valid argument.” This was entirely derailing my attempt to talk to Julia. The dinner table was getting silent as some of the other kids were watching the conflict arise.

“No, Simon.” Mrs. Beckett went on, though I interrupted again.

“Why can I not walk or use my own money to take a bus to a nearby location on my own free time outside of school hours, provided I return at a reasonable time as well?”

“We’re saying you need permission” Mrs. Beckett intoned, annoyance creeping into his voice.

“Fine, do I have permission to go to a store on my own Tuesday or any other day this week after school?”

“No”

“Why?”

“Because we said so, finish your dinner.” Mr. Beckett announced with finality.

Ah, I see. That was how it was going to be. Julia and a couple of the other kids had gotten up and slinked away while I had my tiff with the Beckett’s. It wasn’t like I was the only argumentative one, the other kids certainly had their fair share, and much the same responses and restrictions. As annoying as it was, I wasn’t really being singled out. Whatever, if they weren’t going to let me I’d just have to do it anyway.

Julia disappeared into the girl’s room. With my progress toward further conversation halted, I got on the computer to research cracking those combination locks I had bought. Sure I knew the code, but that wasn’t the point. I typed up some of the instructions into my interface notes so I could try them out tonight shortly.

Nine PM rolled around and we were ushered off into our rooms, the notes worked well, especially in combination with cranking up my sound FX volume and putting my ear to the back of the locks. I soon had all of them picked, and improved levels in my Lockpicking skill. Three hours of practice though already began to show the signs of diminishing returns. Maybe I can return or exchange these again for something more varied or complex. After that I meditated for two hours in the dark, then woke up Spider-Bong.

Julia’s observe window was still up. I had minimized it, but had wanted to keep it up earlier to keep track of it. Its only change now was that she had the Condition ‘Sleeping’. You know I had never really paid attention to that before. Parapedia was rather obvious, ‘Sleeping’ gives a negative effect to PER and mildly improved regen rates for healing, major stamina regen, and the most obvious fatigue regen. No mention of Mana regen for her anyway. I can’t exactly use Observe my own sleep condition. I wonder if her window will stay open when I go to sleep? Only one way to find out.

Monday, January 11th, 2010

I awoke, Julia’s Observe window did not stay open, it auto-closed. I put Spider-Bong back to sleep, and got a new quest. ‘Do well on assessment tests.’ Reward: 250 XP. So I should study? I didn’t know what they were going to cover but I only had the science book to use anyway. I read it until it was time to leave on the school bus with all the other high school kids from the house, except Julia. Didn’t know what she was doing with Mrs. Pearson today, I can try to ask later.

I tried to grind meditation and Observe on the ride over. The former was hard due to bumps and traffic, but was a bit easier compared to the last time I tried on the bus. The latter was easy. I focus on Observing kids and people, and was looking for anyone that cost 3 MP instead of 2, but did not find any. I continued this on into the high school and the office to get registered on so on. It didn’t take long to finally hit level 10.

You have unlocked the view bars block Observe feature.
You have unlocked the FRAPS interface feature (from Observe level 10)

A review of my skills told me that ‘View Bar Blocks’ meant I would be able to see people’s HP, Stamina, MP, Stress, Hunger, Thirst, and Fatigue bars and value when I observed them. I wanted to test that out but I was at the ‘Specialty Dilemma’ again. If I wanted another Observe specialty, I need to only use Observe on what I wanted to get the specialty in. That meant testing it out on people or even using Parapedia to gain more insights into the feature would have to wait. The only pending specialties I could think of were potentially related to vehicles, plants and/or animals, (and also probably tinker-tech and Parahumans, but those were right out.) I need to stick to my rule, always go for the specialty when possible. I’d aim for vehicles, which would mean using Observe on a minimum of 950 unique vehicles, assuming max skill gain with each attempt. (And I probably won’t get max each time) I could probably encounter that many in a day or two. Hell the school’s parking lot looked like it might have a hundred on its own.

I discovered at least, that people’s HP bar was now included in their overhead tag info. So were their names, and class, even when I had no knowledge of that beforehand, not even with clues. That would have some interesting ramifications.

FRAPS seemed pretty cool. I tried it out briefly while waiting for the teachers that would give me my assessment tests. I found it on my interface, turning it on meant I could literally record audio and video as if I had cameras for eyes. It worked just as well when I used free camera, but stayed with the camera I was using. I could go back to my recordings, and replay them. Well, that allowed me to discover a new use for ‘Windowed Mode’ now that I could have two windows for stuff like ‘replay’ and ‘live.’ He’ll I could have done for my text/note windows too.

Your Gamer’s Interface skill has increased by 1

Excellent, playing with new features for the first time always gave me a surge of gains in that skill. Though the surges are was smaller than previously. Bummer, no new skill feature at level 20, maybe level 25?

Test time. Do well huh? Guess best way to do well is to be smarter. I didn’t want to use all my points though, I might need them for an emergency, but I could round some of my stats out. I added +3 to INT and +2 to WIS. My MP max immediately jumped up to 1750 and I gained the difference in MP as well. My regen was almost at an even 1 MP per minute too. Stress points, both current and max likewise jumped by 50 points. I didn’t suddenly feel smarter or wiser, but perhaps I needed to wait more, and try it out like on the tests that I now had to start.

Three hours later, even though I was done early, we got to break for lunch. Rachel had been doing assessment tests also, Janet wasn’t but I wasn’t sure why, she was a senior already so that may have had something to do with it. A lot of kids were taking assessments; because there were a lot of transfers in from survivors of Galveston. I certainly wasn’t alone in the room. Though, while waiting after finishing, I was using Free Camera to view the parking lot and street to start collecting observes on all the cars.

I found Rachel during lunch. “Hey”, I said as I sat down beside her.

“Hey”

“Don’t see the other kids from the house, or Janet.”

“They’re probably in other lunch periods.”

“You know why Julia didn’t come do assessment tests today? I know she’s meeting with Mrs. Pearson today, but that’s all. She didn’t seem to care much at the idea of school.”

“It’s school. School sucks. Otherwise, I’m not sure.”

“Oh, okay, was just hoping someone might know more, the Beckett’s kind of wrecked my attempt to talk to her last night.”

“Man, you’re jonesing after her pretty hard. I think she was talking with her Grandmother some last night. Just don’t get your hopes up”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I really wanted to use an observe again to get a sense of what Rachel was feeling but...

“You like her.”

“I’m trying to be her friend.”

“Yeah sure.”

“No really, I am.”

“What’s that Star Wars thing? There is no try just be.”

“Didn’t know you were a Star Wars fan.”

“My brother was a geek, it bled over.”

“Nothing wrong with that. Release your inner geek Rachel, it compels you.”

“You’re a weird dude Simon, but you’re alright.”

“Thanks? I guess. It doesn’t really answer my earlier question though. What do you mean when you said I shouldn’t get my hopes up?”

“Just that us kids come and go out of foster care. We get moved, we runaway. We return to or get taken away again from parents or relatives. Especially teenagers like us. It’s not reliable. I know, I had cousins in the system.”

“You don’t think she is going to runaway do you?”

“No, but I bet it has crossed her mind, yours too.”

She had me there, I had thought about it, if it weren’t for what I suspected about Julia and a simple quest to be her friend and help her, I probably would have.

“And yours?”

“Yeah sure, everyone does. I act tough, but I know what the results of that are more than most.”

“I don’t think you merely act tough. Care to elaborate?”

“Not really. Just the world is fucked up, people are fucked up and so are we. That doesn’t make it easy to get all feely with people.”

“Yeah I get your perspective. The world shat on us. We’re still trying to swim out of it, and the shore is just the dried up leftovers from the last time it shat on somebody else. But that’s also the kind of situation where having a friend, despite the difficulties, is most beneficial.”

“Yeah I guess…”

All my focus doesn’t really need to stay on Julia does it? I’ve ignored the others plenty already just to pursue my quests and grind my stats and skills. “So, what did you think of those stupid assessment tests? You know what electives you might try and take?...”

+25 relationship with Rachel Zamora

After lunch, all the transfers got shuffled off into the auditorium, I sat next to Rachel again and we continued with idle talk. It was for some kind of incredibly boring orientation, a combination of meet the administrators and guidance counselor pep talk. We were after all a bunch of semi-refugees from an Endbringer attack, so that came with a certain amount of baggage. Then it was just waiting, I guess someone finally finished grading my assessment test because I got a notice of quest completion and gained 250 XP. Then kids got called up one at a time to figure out our schedules. The whole thing took two hours.

For A day classes, I had Spanish, shared with Rachel, Art, English and Geometry, also shared with Rachel. I knew Geometry though, at least according to my skills. So what gives? Apparently for freshman it is an honors class though?

So according to Mr. Mondale that teacher guy I met on Galveston, and my own ‘get to know yourself’ quest info. I was a poor student. Now I seem to qualify for honors classes, or at least some of them. I’m still stuck in regulars English and History cause that’s all the room they had even if I could have done honors level. There was a lot less control over my schedule than I had hoped. I only got to pick two electives from a limited list, which was Spanish and Art. Computer Science was not compatible with the schedule of required classes I got put into.

B day classes, I had Biology, History, Health and PE. Today was an A day class, but we would not be going. School was from 8am to 3:10pm, 4 periods, 35 minute rotating lunches during 3rd period. At least PE was at the end of the day, small blessings.

Then it was time to get back on the bus and go home. More semi-successful meditation, and lots of Observing vehicles on the roads, including construction vehicles and boats. We even had to wait for a train and I snagged an Observe on the locomotive. I wondered if trailers or bicycles would count as vehicles or not, but it wouldn’t be worth risking it.

We got home and had to immediately get ready to get driven off to the counseling sessions again. More meditating and Observing during the car rides and of course the session itself. It was about fruitful as the last ones, but my gains were losing steam. During my one on one, I talked about trying to overcome the PTSD induced aqua-phobia, and well as the other triggering stuff with better exposure therapy. That really meant easing into attempts at swimming, even though the idea still freaked me out. That took some convincing, but I got an actual written recommendation out of it this time. I also even watched some short videos of the fucking Chupacabra during my one on one. I knew it was going to grind my Gamer’s Mind, and it did, a lot. It was still nerve wracking though, but it was a hell of a lot easier than the last time I saw the fucker.

I had also hit level 4 in both Psychology and Empathy. Both had specialties so they stopped at 0%, but were also passive, which made them a hell of a lot harder to target specialties for. I had to think how to gain new ones, and kinda had to mentally shut down so I wouldn’t ‘contaminate’ further gains. Fortunately I had a trained counselor/psychologist person that let me talk and ask about whatever and was a good source of information. He told me about the different types of Empathy and various fields and specialties within Psychology. I had FRAPS record the whole thing so I could transcribe and research it later.

We all piled back into the car. Julia at least had been to the counseling session again. I resisted the urge to use Observe on her again. <Julia Mendez, Foster Kid/Delinquent, Lvl 13> Her Overhead Tag hadn’t changed other than now including a mostly green filled but with a slightly red sliver at the end, health bar below it. Via video game logic I assume the red means loss of HP, and full green means max HP. Mine own appeared as full green in a bathroom mirror, and I am at max. So I guess she is mildly injured in some way? I don’t know how many actual HP she has, or anyone else for that matter. Could always just use Observe, but…fuck. No, resist the temptation. I stared out the window whispering Observe at the cars in the parking lot instead.

“You always mumble that word a lot. Why?” Julia asked after sliding into the seat next to me.

Startled, I turned toward her and our arms brushed. “Ow! Damn.” I yelled as a static shock hit my arm with an audible pop.

“Shit, sorry...dry air”

The fuck? “Didn’t think anyone could even hear over Rachel and Janet arguing.”

“Well, some kind of mantra or something? You seem different, a bit.”

“Well I do meditate sometimes, mostly after lights off before simply sleeping. Maybe it’s more just a reminder to pay attention. Little good it did me with you startling me, and literally shocking me with your presence.” I seem a bit different? How, what did she notice?

“So how was school and the test stuff?”

“Meh, boring, took forever, talked with Rachel over lunch though, then I finally got a schedule at the end of it.”

“She mentioned that.”

“That all she mentioned?”

“Um, yeah?”

Damn why am I nervous? Still can’t ask her what I really want to, not here. “So will I see you in school eventually?”

Julia looked forlorn and sighed. “I don’t know. Not sure what is going to happen yet.”

“Legal stuff?”

“No, that’s supposedly over with now.”

“Then...” What had Rachel said? Kids come and go, but even if Julia had thought of running off, that would not have prevent normal school registration. “Rachel said you spoke with your Grandmother? Are you..”

“Maybe? I don’t know. Contacting family that’s what CPS does. Lita Maria, my paternal grandmother, she lives in Mexico, but doesn’t really have the capacity to care for herself let alone someone else. She…didn’t even understand what had happened. Not that it apparently matters, ‘It’s not Texas CPS policy to send a charge out of country.’ My other grandmother, I haven’t even seen her but once when I was four. My mother and she were not exactly close.”

So is she leaving? Registering for school would be pointless if she was. “So was that what you were discussing with Mrs. Pearson?”

“Sorta. They found my mom’s car.”

“…Oh.”

“Scuba divers, taking photos of license plates. Hit a match out of thousands of photos. Was lucky that it was visible and legible at all. They are all buried too deep in the silt to retrieve.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Hey at least the fucking insurance company has evidence of loss now.” She said with a pained fake smile. “They won’t do crap about my dad’s truck, cause it’s perfectly fine. Just have to convince the Navy to remove it off a condemned island, or wait for a new bridge to be built, which will probably be never.”

I didn’t know what to say to that so we sat in silence again for a while. I whispered Observe at the passing cars.

“How’s counseling been going?” Julia only shrugged in response. I was still at a loss as to what defined helping her over her trauma. Hell, I am surprised I didn’t get a quest to retrieve her dad’s truck. And no, you troll. I do not want a quest to do that. “I ramped up my exposure therapy today, trying to overcome those PTSD triggers. Had to watch videos of ol’ aquatic Chupacabra, it’s helping I guess, even if its…you know.”

“Yeah…I’ve done some, not ready for that much.”

“Simon you have chores tonight and need to help with Dinner.” Mrs. Beckett announced as we pulled into the house. I audibly groaned.

****​

Julia helped with a portion of the chores, and we talked about more mundane stuff. I got some minor XP off the chores. She wasn’t going to be at school again tomorrow due to another meeting with Mrs. Pearson. I had one too coming later this week. I still wanted to buy the phone off her if it could get repaired, but still didn’t know if I could afford both without visiting the repair shop. It was closed before we got back so couldn’t call. I’d have to skip the bus home tomorrow, defy their orders and go myself tomorrow afternoon.

I wanted to push the exposure therapy stuff more. I researched more of it on the computer based on my psychologist’s recommendations from today. The session earlier got me nearly to the next Gamer’s Mind level, a bit more might get me the rest of the way. I decided to try an experiment. Took a full tub bath despite aqua-phobia, shower coming down on me, and replayed the fucking videos in my interface window that I had recorded on FRAPS form today’s session. It worked. I got to the next level and a ways into the level after that, even though I thought my heart was going to explore out of my chest. I was gaining Gamer’s Mind and Psychology out of it, weird but I’ll take it. I’ll try another round of it tomorrow morning.

I spent the rest of the evening reading the Earth science textbook. Homework will start up soon enogh I’m sure and take yet more time away. Best to get it finished off early. I skipped doing meditation tonight, played with picking the combo-locks again until I stopped getting gains. Then used free camera to Observe all the vehicles in the neighborhood within my radius. Unfortunately that way less than what I was getting from parking lots or on the road. I should swing by the mall or the Costco parking lot tomorrow. A new thing I learned after Observing a passing car and leaving the window up. Observe windows will also auto-close if the car (target?) goes out of range. Don’t know what that range is, so that is something else to figure out later. Now it’s time to wake up Spider-Bong and go to sleep.

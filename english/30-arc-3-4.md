<Balluri Ababil/Shatterbird, Villain, Level ??>

“RUN!” I yell, move the observe window aside, no time to read. Mini-map, Jack, Bonesaw and Crawler are nearby, coming up behind us near the fence.

“Stop stabbing them in the brain, Shatterbird! I need those!” Bonesaw yells, far too close for comfort, we race down the street.

<”This way!”> I’m yelling again, moving away from the enemy dots on my map. Unread notifications flash at me.

-120 HP [Fire Damage] (4 Resisted)

“AHHHH!” I’m screaming, pain, pain horrid pain! Instinctively I reel back from the fucking giant wall of fire blocking our path of retreat.

-60 HP [Fire Damage] (4 Resisted)

Shit! I’m still on fire!

<”Stop, drop, roll, Simon!”> Chela yells, shoving me onto the ground. She smothers the flames with her own jacket. Jordan is helping.

-42 HP [Fire Damage] (4 Resisted)
-20 HP [Fire Damage] (4 Resisted)
-10 HP [Fire Damage] (6 Resisted)

“Inventory…burning…clothes…fuck, ow fuck!”

-8 HP (8 Resisted)

Fire is finally out, after ripping some skin off by inventorying my burnt clothes. I glanced over at the others. Fuck Ruben got burned too; he is cradling his left arm, not nearly as badly as me. I’m fucking roast hamburger on my arms and frost torso. Chela’s hands are singed, her jacket ruined.

A flash of movement comes from inside the flame wall. A pale young woman with dark brown hair is standing in the flames, un-burnt, wearing a pink sweater over a white-collared shirt and black pleated skirt. Familiar overhead text appears above her.

<Mimi Willow/Burnscar, Villain, Level ???> “Observe”

Then with a “POIT” she’s gone.

<”Can’t go that way! We’re trapped!”> Carmen cries.

“OH GOD! THEY’RE HERE!” Jordan yells, scrambling backward only to come back to the group as the flames encircle our position, leaving no room to flee.

“…I told you, your stupid knock-off game wouldn’t work! Now what the hell are we waiting for?” Shatterbird yells angrily from overhead.

“Come on now Balluri, don’t be such a spoilsport.” Jack says with a raised, yet calm voice, which carries over the sounds of the crackling flames.

“Yeah! It’s bound to work eventually again. It did before.” Bonesaw’s gleeful voice rises up as the two of them walk through the wall of flames toward us, unharmed. Standing in between them is a naked black and white striped woman, each arm resting on their shoulders. It’s the Siberian, fuck me.

<Exotic Dimensional Matter Projection, Level ?????> The fuck? “Observe…”

    A Dimensional Matter Projection
    This is a power manifestation produced by negative energy which siphons off exotic dimensional matter to form a humanoid shape of someone of personal importance to the Master who manifested it.

    It is immune to all non-dimensional laws of physics. It has no stats or HP.

    Status: Controlled

Fuck, “close,” stay in the now. My HP is uncomfortably low, more unread notifications now, but can’t spend time to look at them.

“FIRE! FIRE FIRE! FIRE!” Burnscar screams from somewhere to my left.

“Settle down, Mimi, settle down.” Jack sighs. “Ned, you mind smothering the flames?”

Crawler walks into the fire wall and lies down on the ground smothering half the flames Burnscar manifested. “You said I could have one, after the house,” Crawlers rumbles.

Pump it. Put it all in CON and run through the fire, you could survive it. But the others won’t, fuck, I… “Stats…”

“Fine, fine, take the red-head; he’s probably too old for the experiment anyway.” Jack says, while flipping an axe in his hand. My axe, the one David was holding when he…

“AHHHH!” Greg screams as one of Crawlers forked limbs grabs him and lifts him into the air suspending him over his dripping, open maw.

+4 CON, come on. I watch as some of my wounds become less grisly as my HP goes up from the boosts.

“NOOOOOO!” Greg swings the bat I had lent him, hammering uselessly against Crawler’s limb. Everyone is screaming, except me.

FUCK! +4 CON, more, more…

“Don’t eat his head!” Bonesaw yells over the din. Crawler just angles his head slightly to look toward Jack and Bonesaw.

“Well, you heard the little lady.” Jack responds, and Crawler reaches a second limb up to where he was holding Greg and…

+4 CON, got to get the fuck out of here.

“I hope you choke on---“ …Greg yells, then…. Fuck. Jordan, screams louder, Chela throws up despite Ruben trying to shield her eyes. I…fuck, focus, have to run.

“Yea!” Bonesaw squeals and pulls a jar filled with a transparent green liquid out of her backpack and skips over to where Greg’s….

+4 CON, faster damn it.

For reaching 50 in CON you have gained the Fast Recovery perk!

“Stealth” Run while they’re distracted, grab what water I have in my inventory.

-62 HP [Fire Damage] (6 Resisted)
-35 HP [Fire Damage] (6 Resisted)
-14 HP [Fire Damage] (6 Resisted)

Fuck… “Inventory pants” roll, put out the flames, put my costume armor back on.

-6 HP (8 Resisted)
-1 HP [Fire Damage] (6 Resisted)
-0 HP [Fire Damage] (3 Resisted)

Oh, God, I’m so sorry Chela, I can’t save any of you….I’m such a failure. Keep running, can’t see, why? Too many tears, Oh God everything hurts so much. It’s too much; I just want to find Julia again, I don’t have anyone, no family. Everyone’s going to die, I can’t save… Too many notifica… Fuck, why is there music playing? Why is my music playing? WHY IS MY HUD FLICKERING??!!?!??

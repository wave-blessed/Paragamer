3 of 5 events achieved for Quest: Become a Cape!

Well those were some nice gains. I sat back down on the bed in a room I rented yet again from that cash hotel, and took stock of the evening. Well Miguel wasn’t at the day labor hang-out; few people were, because it was late by the time I got there. So there was no luck with that. I had the haul from my ‘shopping trip’ spread out all over the bed so I could organize it. I had to replace the costume pieces I lost. Man I really liked that trench-coat too, but it smelled like burnt hair, because that’s what happened. I’ll need to toss that.

So, more food, supplies, and clothing cause my pants had buckshot holes in them. I stripped them off, have to toss these too. I healed up a bit more after having eaten some more, so less need for the bandages, but fuck, my leg still itches at the wound spots. “Observe”

“What really? Inventory ‘shredded bits of denim’. ” Well, that’s better. At least I didn’t lose any HP this time. Hmm, weird, so I can use Observe on wounds or individual body parts? Is target all just a matter of intent? I guess that’s more useful, is this a new thing or maybe I just never tried that before. No, I have sorta, Parapedia is just using Observe on individual words on a large pop-up.

Time to opened up all the additional stolen software an upload it to my interface, and FRAPS the product keys, I guess. I can dump the packaging and physical media tomorrow.

I looked over the three pairs of handcuffs I had pulled out of my inventory. One was courtesy of the Houston PD. The other pairs, I got because I they came with a key which I needed. You can’t just buy (or rather steal) hand-cuffs from any old store. I had to buy these from a sex shop, yeah too small and camera laden to steal from, and they didn’t exactly have shopping carts. I glanced at the few other items I bought from there; they can just stay in my inventory. At least I can get rid of the media items now that they are uploaded. I pulled out the book though, and skimmed through it a bit. Will it give me a quest? No? Fuck you then. Maybe I can get a skill if I read the thing, later though.

So even if just use inventory to get rid of hand-cuffs, I maybe I should to know how to pick them any---. You’ve got to be kidding? It’s that easy, really? I didn’t even gain any lock-picking skill XP. Yep, it was definitely that easy. Well these will work better than duct tape, so should the zip-ties.

I turned on the news. There were pockets of EMP and lightning blasts around Houston apparently from the fight between Sparky, Granite and some other villainous cape I don’t even recall seeing and the Protectorate. And for some reason Eidolon was still a no show? Something to do with him helping against some threat somewhere else? Damn Sparky is a Blaster and Shaker, numbers unreleased. Uh, when did Sparky become leader of the Secessionists? Oh and the villains got away, as usual.

This phone sucks for web browsing, and this cheap hotel doesn’t have Wi-Fi or a business center. I need to hit the library tomorrow.

I guess for now I get to do more joyous grinding all night and tomorrow. I didn’t have enough clay left for a striking target but I did bring back a big wooden log to chop at. Hopefully it won’t be too loud, but it can’t be worse than the damn overpass noise or some of the room neighbors.

-1 HP [Fire Damage] (0 Resisted) x50

For performing a repeated action you may gain the ‘Damage Resistance (Fire & Heat)’ skill

    Damage Resistance (Fire & Heat) (CON) (Passive): Level: 1 (0.00%)
    Your Avatar state alters itself to resist ever increasing damage received from oxidizing combustion sources. This allows you to withstand fire and heat as skill level increases. Requires Avatar feature of Gamer’s Body.

    Specialties: NA
    Features unlocked: None



Good god that hurts, glad I stole bottles of burn ointment; 50 fucking tiny burns in 50 different spots on my body from a stupid candle and lighter. Just to get that skill. Definite yes, but that’s a fuck-load of HP loss that is only going to get worse trying to grind that. I’d kinda of rather be back up to my maximum rather than losing more right now. It will take days just to heal what I am missing right now. At least now if I suddenly get burned unexpectedly I won’t have to go through my notifications to find it and say yes to it. How many other damage types are there?

Having regained enough stamina again, I went back to whacking my log. Wood chips were flying everywhere; I’ll have to clean that up later. Power Strike and Melee weapons were gaining though. I kept alternating, power strike, melee and CON grinding from stamina loss, then grind INT and work on the chemistry book quest, waiting for my stamina to recover and repeat. During the whole time, I could wait for my actual fatigue points to reach zero to start abusing the power nap exploits.

Your Melee Weapons skill has increased by 1

What no specialty? Why? Fuck, used stupid bat on redneck dudes.

Your Power Strike skill has increased by 1
For testing the limits of your endurance and vitality, you have gained 1 CON

I went well past my fatigue hitting 0, into Sunday morning just to get that extra point. Simply so that my power nap periods could be shorted, since my regen rates go up as it raises.

Sunday, February 21st, 2010

You may gain the ‘Machetes’ specialty for Melee Weapons

That was all I could manage to get to before I had to stop the rest exploit until I’d been awake enough to drain fatigue down again, so it was off to the library to download stuff and see what the hell is going on.

I download as much as I could related to subject on skills that I had, Biology, Earth Science, Psychology, Programming, Parahuman Lore, Strategy, Meditation, Medicine, Mathematics and Computers. At the very least it would give me reading material on the bus ride, presuming I can fake off the ID. I already knew from my past conversation with the laborers that Sundays were slimmer pickings with most, both laborers and hiring contractors going to church or such. I’d have to be over thee super early Monday morning though. I kept read my chemistry book in the library while at the computer, and only took a break to power strike the dumpster outside a few times to drain off Stamina when it got close to maxing out. No axe this time, just fists. Unarmed really needed to go up, and I think I already ruined a specialty shot for this level. That was another something to fix ASAP after getting out of here.

…the Parahuman designated by the Protectorate and PRT as Sparky (he refers to himself as Arc, not to be confused with the Protectorate hero Ark operating out of Seattle) has been assigned as a tentative Blaster/Shaker/Striker 5, Brute 2* (due to demonstrated immunity to all forms of electrical stun based weaponry)…

…It is currently rumored that he has taken over leadership of the Secessionists sometime after the Leviathan attack on Galveston last year. The Secessionists were originally an ideological and political protest group which had occasional clashes with police and border officials due to vigilante activities and the targeting of Hispanic minorities, refugees, and those suspected of being illegal immigrants. Since the supposed take over the group has becoming increasingly more violent, has exhibited gang behavior and begun forays into organized crime…

…Sparky has been known to generate electrical energy ex nihilo, and blast it from his hands in the form of electric arcs which have the appearance of lightning bolts at a range of up to several hundred feet and capable of causing significant death, injury and devastation, although no deaths from these blasts have been reported so far.

Sparky has also produced EMP bursts that have covered entire areas up to a city block in diameter or more. These bursts are silent and without any visual component, and while just like normal EMP bursts, they do not cause any damage to humans or living creatures, they render all unshielded electronics in the area of effect useless or outright destroyed, resulting in significant property damage and disruption…

Well holy shit. I am so out-classed by that it’s not funny. So he is an electricity generator and manipulator; not that it wasn’t already obvious from the lightning bolt that almost fried me yesterday. Julia has some kinds of electricity power of some kind also, at least I assume so. Does that pretty well confirm our multi-trigger scenario? Multi-triggers are grab bags though with multiple powers, is the electricity stuff his primary, secondary, what? Did Julia get her bit from him or him from her? Where do I fit into this? Did Julia get some of my power and I some of hers? Did sparky? My power is so fucking weird and doesn’t match up with what I have learned so far. Though, the majority of my power isn’t visible to anyone so if they did have some aspect of it I might not be able to tell myself. Hey Julia can you see illusionary computer windows interface screens that do various things? Yeah I’ll get right on asking her that. My golems are my only real visible power, but I didn’t even start with that.

What does PHO say about me?

Posted on February 20, 2010:

So apparent new cape gets into a fight with Sparky and Granite during an altercation that had the Houston PD out in force near my neighborhood. Though where was the PRT in this? Anyway I saw Sparky doing a lightshow, that's fucking scary, but this is about the other guy.

Word is he controlled a bunch of snakes and sicced them on some ganger redneck types then swarmed Sparky afterwards. Sparky lit the neighborhood up. Literally fucking EMP blast destroyed my phones my computer, everything electronic in our entire neighboor block

I mention this because I know its normal to ask for or post video/photo proof but that is literally impossible becausemy phone is now a brick. (posting from friend's computer, for the shit-poster that ask me how)

Anyways does anyone know anything about this guy? He ran through our aparment complex after the fight, hockey helmet, goggles, boots, giant ass fur-coat that looked all singed as hell. (Must have caught a blast from sparky?)

Once again WTF was the Houston PD thinking engaging them? Where was the PRT why weren't they brought in? Instead Sparky goes off on another rampage! Just goes to show you how inefective the government is at everything!

I'm telling nothing will happen until he takes out a hospital or major corporate office building or some shit offline with one of those blasts. so long as its just effecting poor minoroitty neighborhoods, nobodies gonna do shit.

Thank you for your concern. My husband was not invlvoed in that directly no, and he has not mentioned any deaths of any fellow officers, some injuries yes, but nothing critical, thank god.

@SampsonOverride

What I have heard is that the Houston PD were responding to a report of gang assault on some minorities, there was no mention of Cape Involvement. By the time it had become apparentl that villianous capes were involved, Sparky had already blasted the area and took out all communication, so they could not call in the PRT right away and had to do a fighting retreat.

Replied on February 20, 2010:
A fightin retreat calls for a massive shoot out? WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!

► Xanthick (Veteran Member)
Replied on February 20, 2010:
@angrybeavers

Yes actually, that is exactly what a fighting retreat means. Pin down your opponent with fire so you can get your people out of there.

Have you not seen tonight's news report showing the aftermath of what Sparky did to those three squad cars? This guy wasn't pulling punches, several people could have died, A lethal self defense response was fully justified.

I really hope this proves enough of an example the PRT will stop fucking around enough and end guys like him. Capes are not invulnerable as much as they want you to think that. You have to take protection into your own hadns, That's why our right to conceal and carry is so damn important. You never know if some yahoo near you is actually some cape that is going to flip out and go Carrie on a gorup of people. Alot of the shit I read about wouldn't have happened if somebody was packin..

'Asaault on minorities', that's code for someone busting up illegals. Now I don't advocate any kind of assault, but there are some legitimate complaints. The economy of great nation has been in shambles for decades.continuing to bring in a bunch of refugees and illegal immigrants that take all our jobs is just making things worse.

We need to make America great again.

Alright we've finally been cleared to release a official statement about the incident and the capes involved, please see the Houston PRT website for the full details.

For now. I can just what we have released about this cape here as well.

The male cape, based on what we know has been designated with the name 'Potter'. He is Master (rating pending) that can control small animal and insect figurines of unnatural flexibility and durability compared to the materials they were made from, so far being raw clay or ceremics.

Potter is currently wanted for questioning for his involvement in the incident yesterday, and two prior incidents, including unregistered vigilantism.

I strongly resisted the urge to post in my own thread. Fuck would doing so qualify as a cape event? No need to risk that right now, not without a lot more precautions. Right now I had a PR event to spy on.

I’d gone to this library because it was near where the Houston Protectorate was doing one of their things. Despite getting there early, I was in the far back among the pleebs, forward areas for ticket buyers only. Fortunately my free camera got me a much closer bird’s eye view.

I didn’t really care about what they were saying all that much. More thanks and remembrances of the fallen from recent attack, even though there had been several memorial vigils already. Lots of reporters asking pre-prepared questions. Most of the Houston Protectorate and wards were out. “Observe, Observe, observe, observe…”

    Summary Description: Mandy is the grand-daughter of a billionaire Texas oil and energy tycoon. Her lifelong dream was to become a hero. Already immensely spoiled by a lavish lifestyle, she got her wish several weeks ago on when her Grandpa bought her powers for her birthday. Although he had hoped to mold her into a Corporate Hero to help strengthen the family goals and finances, after significant disagreement, she decided to join the wards for now to receive training, while tabling the decision about whether she would join the Protectorate or go Corporate after she turns eighteen. Barred by secrecy about revealing how she obtained her powers, she claims they were obtained during the Leviathan attack on Galveston when one of the family yachts was sunk by tidal waves.

Some minutes later my mind recovered from blue-screen. I thought that was a rumor. I fucking thought that was a rumor. Holy fucking shit. Are you fucking trolling me right now? Are you? I swear to God if you are, then I have no idea what I’d actually do about it but, fuuuuuuck.

Oh shit Eidolon is talking and I missed most of it, good thing FRAPs is active.

“…regarding the villain known as Sparky, we are without a doubt seeking him. While we are not sure if he is capable of destruction of that magnitude yet, I hope he is watching this, because if he ever does emit a city-sized or larger EMP burst, a pre-authorized kill order is prepared for that level of economic destruction.”

Ow, ow ow, fucking headache. I dismissed Eidolon’s window resumed normal camera mode and popped a pill.

Umm, okay, what the fuck is up with that? More shit to research later. I swapped back to free camera and snagged Observes on the rest of the Houston Protectorate and Wards that were there. Mind fucking blown. Most of them had Conflict-Seeking, however plenty did not. All of those that didn’t had a similar story in their summary about bought powers. Except Eidolon, but I had no idea about him because Observe blew chunks and gave me a headache both times I tried it on the green goblin.

Okay getting weird bad vibes now, I’m leaving.

Several hours of Racquetball at 24 hour fitness got my an AGI point, even so doing that for that long starts to make people wonder, so I found myself trying to do similar playing around with a volleyball I found on the beach at night.

Traipsing about in the dark, I came across an abandoned half-wreck sandcastle, yet it was pretty large and ornate for what was left. Well no one was around, so I kicked it over.

-4 HP (3 Deflected, 2 Resisted)

Ow, shit God damn it. Making sure no one was around watching; I tried vacuuming up the sand into my inventory. Hmm, that is a useful trick.

Someone had built up the sand over several rocks, using them to fill in the interior spaces and molding the wet sand around it. Interesting idea, to give the form internal structure. I wonder if Sand Castle making is a separate skill or part of Craft Stone and Pottery? I experimented with pulling sand into and out of my inventory I made a crude figure out of sand that was lying on his back, but didn’t see any skill changes or new skill prompts. Not that I would have taken a sand-castle building skill, which seemed rather silly. Just wanted to know far it would go. O well, I kicked a bunch of driftwood aside and heading back up to the bus stop to get to the hotel to do more power napping and grinding.

3 of 5 events achieved for Quest: Become a Cape!

Well those are some nice gains. I sit back down on the bed in a room I rented yet again from the cash hotel, and take stock of the evening. Miguel wasn’t at the day labor hang-out; few people were. It was late when I got there, so no luck with that. I have the haul from my ‘shopping trip’ spread out all over the bed to organize it. I have to replace costume pieces I lost. Man, I really liked that trench-coat, but it smells like burnt hair, because that’s what happened. I need to toss it.

More food, supplies, and clothing cause my pants have buckshot holes in them. I strip them off, have to toss these too. I heal up a bit more after eating, so less need for the bandages, but fuck, my leg still itches at the wound spots. “Observe”

“What, really? Inventory ‘shredded bits of denim’.” That’s better. At least I didn’t lose any HP this time. Weird, so I can use Observe on wounds or individual body parts? Is target all just a matter of intent? I guess that’s useful, is this a new thing or just something I never tried that before? No, I have, Parapedia is just using Observe on individual words on a large pop-up.

I need to upload all the stolen software to my interface. I can dump the packaging and physical media tomorrow. I look over the three pairs of handcuffs I pulled out of my inventory. One is courtesy of the Houston PD. The other pairs, I got because they came with a key which I needed. I had to buy these from a sex shop, yeah too small and camera laden to steal from, and they didn’t have shopping carts. I glance at the few other items I bought from there; they can just stay in my inventory. I pull out the book though, and skim through it a bit. Will it give me a quest? No? Fuck you then. Maybe I can get a skill if I read the thing, later though.

So even if just use inventory to get rid of hand-cuffs, I should know how to pick them any---. You’ve got to be kidding? It’s that easy, really? I didn’t even gain any disable device skill XP, yep, definitely that easy. These will work better than duct tape, so will the zip-ties.

I turn on the news. There were pockets of EMP and lightning blasts around Houston apparently from the fight between Sparky, Granite and some other villainous cape I don’t even recall seeing and the Protectorate. And for some reason Eidolon was still a no show? It’s something to do with him helping against some threat somewhere else? Damn Sparky is a Blaster and Shaker, numbers unreleased. Uh, when did Sparky become leader of the Secessionists? Oh and the villains got away, as usual.

This phone sucks for web browsing, and this cheap hotel doesn’t have Wi-Fi or a business center. I need to hit the library tomorrow.

I guess I get to do more joyous grinding all night and tomorrow. I look at the big wooden log I brought back to chop at. Hopefully it won’t be too loud, but it can’t be worse than the damn overpass noise or some of the room neighbors.

-1 HP [Fire Damage] (0 Resisted) x50
For performing a repeated action you may gain the ‘Damage Resistance (Fire & Heat)’ skill

    Damage Resistance (Fire & Heat) (CON) (Passive): Level: 1 (0.00%)
    Your Avatar state alters itself to resist ever increasing damage received from oxidizing combustion sources. This allows you to withstand fire and heat as skill level increases. Requires Avatar feature of Gamer’s Body.

    Specialties: NA
    Features unlocked: None


Good God that hurts, glad I stole bottles of burn ointment; 50 fucking tiny burns in 50 different spots on my body from a lighter. Just to get that skill. Definite yes, but that’s a fuck-load of HP loss that is only going to get worse trying to grind that. I’d rather be back up to my maximum than losing more right now. It will take days just to heal what I’m missing right now. At least now if I suddenly get burned unexpectedly I won’t have to go through my notifications to find it and say yes to it. How many other damage types are there?

Having regained enough stamina again, I go back to whacking my log. Wood chips are flying everywhere; I’ll have to clean that up later. Power Strike and Melee weapons are gaining. I keep alternating, power strike, melee and CON grinding from stamina loss, then grind INT and work on the chemistry book quest, wait for my stamina to recover and repeat. During the whole time, I can wait for my actual fatigue points to reach zero to start abusing the power nap exploits.

Your Melee Weapons skill has increased by 1

What no specialty? Why? Fuck, used stupid bat on redneck dudes.

Your Power Strike skill has increased by 1
For testing the limits of your endurance and vitality, you have gained 1 CON

I go well past my fatigue hitting 0, into Sunday morning just to get that extra point. So that my power nap periods can be shorted. My regen rates go up as it rises.

Sunday, February 21st, 2010

You may gain the ‘Machetes’ specialty for Melee Weapons

Finally, I have to stop the rest exploit until I’ve been awake enough to drain fatigue down again. So, off to the library to download stuff and see what the hell is going on.

I download as much as I can related to subjects of skills I have, Biology, Earth Science, Psychology, Programming, Parahuman Lore, Strategy, Meditation, Medicine, Mathematics and Computers. I’ll have reading material on the bus ride, presuming I can fake my ID. Sundays are slimmer pickings with both laborers and hiring contractors going to church or such. I’ll have to be over there super early Monday morning. I read my chemistry book in the library while at the computer, and take a break to power strike the dumpster outside a few times to drain off Stamina when it get close to it maxing out. No axe this time, just fists. Unarmed really needs to go up, I think I already ruined a specialty shot for this level. That’s another thing to fix ASAP after getting out of here.

* * * *

…the Parahuman designated by the Protectorate and PRT as Sparky (he refers to himself as Arc, not to be confused with the Protectorate hero Ark operating out of Seattle) has been assigned as a tentative Blaster/Shaker/Striker 6, Brute 2* (due to demonstrated immunity to all forms of electrical stun based weaponry)…

…It is currently rumored that he has taken over leadership of the Secessionists sometime after the Leviathan attack on Galveston last year. The Secessionists were originally an ideological and political protest group which had occasional clashes with police and border officials due to vigilante activities and the targeting of Hispanic minorities, refugees, and those suspected of being illegal immigrants. Since the supposed take over the group has becoming increasingly more violent, has exhibited gang behavior and begun forays into organized crime…

…Sparky has been known to generate electrical energy ex nihilo, and blast it from his hands in the form of electric arcs which have the appearance of lightning bolts at a range of up to several hundred feet and capable of causing significant death, injury and devastation, although no deaths from these blasts have been reported so far.

Sparky has also produced EMP bursts that have covered entire areas up to a city block in diameter or more. These bursts are silent and without any visual component, and while just like normal EMP bursts, they do not cause any damage to humans or living creatures, they render all unshielded electronics in the area of effect useless or outright destroyed, resulting in significant property damage and disruption…

Well holy shit. I am so out-classed by that it’s not funny. So he is an electricity generator and manipulator. That was already obvious from the lightning bolt that almost fried me yesterday. Julia has some kind of electricity power also, at least I assume so. Does that confirm our multi-trigger scenario? Multi-triggers are grab bags with multiple powers, is the electricity stuff his primary, secondary, what? Did Julia get her bit from him or him from her? Where do I fit into this? Did Julia get some of my power and I some of hers? Did Sparky? My power is so fucking weird and doesn’t match up with what I have learned so far. Though, the majority of my power isn’t visible to anyone so if they do have some aspect of it I might not be able to tell myself. Hey Julia can you see illusionary computer windows interface screens that do various things? Yeah I’ll get right on asking her that. My golems are my only real visible power, but I didn’t even start with that.

What does PHO say about me?

♦Topic: New Snake Controlling Cape in Houston?

Posted on February 20, 2010:

So apparent new cape gets into a fight with Sparky and Granite during an altercation that had the Houston PD out in force near my neighborhood. Though where was the PRT in this? Anyway I saw Sparky doing a lightshow, that's fucking scary, but this is about the other guy.

Word is he controlled a bunch of snakes and sicced them on some ganger redneck types then swarmed Sparky afterwards. Sparky lit the neighborhood up. Literally fucking EMP blast destroyed my phones my computer, everything electronic in our entire neighboor block

I mention this because I know its normal to ask for or post video/photo proof but that is literally impossible becausemy phone is now a brick. (posting from friend's computer, for the shit-poster that ask me how)

Anyways does anyone know anything about this guy? He ran through our aparment complex after the fight, hockey helmet, goggles, boots, giant ass fur-coat that looked all singed as hell. (Must have caught a blast from sparky?)

Once again WTF was the Houston PD thinking engaging them? Where was the PRT why weren't they brought in? Instead Sparky goes off on another rampage! Just goes to show you how ineffective the government is at everything!

I'm telling you nothing will happen until he takes out a hospital or major corporate office building or some shit offline with one of those blasts. so long as its just effecting poor minority neighborhoods, nobodies going do shit.

Thank you for your concern. My husband was not invlvoed in that directly no, and he has not mentioned any deaths of any fellow officers, some injuries yes, but nothing critical, thank god.

@SampsonOverride
What I have heard is that the Houston PD were responding to a report of gang assault on some minorities, there was no mention of Cape Involvement. By the time it had become apparent that villainous capes were involved, Sparky had already blasted the area and took out all communication, so they could not call in the PRT right away and had to do a fighting retreat.

@angrybeavers
Yes actually, that is exactly what a fighting retreat means. Pin down your opponent with fire so you can get your people out of there.

Have you not seen tonight's news report showing the aftermath of what Sparky did to those three squad cars? This guy wasn't pulling punches, several people could have died, A lethal self defense response was fully justified.

I really hope this proves enough of an example the PRT will stop fucking around enough and end guys like him. Capes are not invulnerable as much as they want you to think that. You have to take protection into your own hadns, That's why our right to conceal and carry is so damn important. You never know if some yahoo near you is actually some cape that is going to flip out and go Carrie on a gorup of people. Alot of the shit I read about wouldn't have happened if somebody was packin..

'Asaault on minorities', that's code for someone busting up illegals. Now I don't advocate any kind of assault, but there are some legitimate complaints. The economy of great nation has been in shambles for decades.continuing to bring in a bunch of refugees and illegal immigrants that take all our jobs is just making things worse.

Alright we've finally been cleared to release an official statement about the incident and the capes involved, please see the Houston PRT website for the full details.

For now, I can just what we have released about this cape here as well.

The male cape, based on what we know has been designated with the name 'Potter'. He is Master (rating pending) that can control small animal and insect figurines of unnatural flexibility and durability compared to the materials they were made from, so far being raw clay or ceramics.

Potter is currently wanted for questioning for his involvement in the incident yesterday, and two prior incidents, including unregistered vigilantism.

I resist the urge to post in my own thread. Fuck, would doing so qualify as a cape event? No need to risk that right now, not without more precautions. Right now I have a PR event to spy on. Despite getting there early, I’m in the far back among the pleebs, forward areas for ticket buyers only. Fortunately my free camera gets me a much closer bird’s eye view.

I don’t really care about what they are saying all that much. There’s more thanks and remembrances of the fallen from recent attack, even though there’s been several memorial vigils already. Lots of reporters asking pre-prepared questions. Most of the Houston Protectorate and wards are out. “Observe, Observe, observe, observe…”

    Summary Description:
    Mandy is the grand-daughter of a billionaire Texas oil and energy tycoon. Her lifelong dream was to become a hero. Already immensely spoiled by a lavish lifestyle, she got her wish several weeks ago on when her Grandpa bought her powers for her birthday. Although he had hoped to mold her into a Corporate Hero to help strengthen the family goals and finances, after significant disagreement, she decided to join the wards for now to receive training, while tabling the decision about whether she would join the Protectorate or go Corporate after she turns eighteen. Barred by secrecy about revealing how she obtained her powers, she claims they were obtained during the Leviathan attack on Galveston when one of the family yachts was sunk by tidal waves.

Ow, ow ow, fucking migraine. I dismiss Eidolon’s window resume normal camera mode and pop a pill. Okay, what the fuck is up with that? More shit to research later. I swap back to free camera and snag Observes on the rest of the Houston Protectorate and Wards that are there. Mind fucking blown. Most of them have Conflict-Seeking, however some do not. All those that don’t, have a similar story in their summary about bought powers. Except Eidolon, but I had no idea about him. “Observe”

Ow, ow, ow, fuck me. Why is observe blowing chunks and giving me a headache when I try it on the green goblin? Okay getting weird bad vibes now, I’m leaving.

You Observe skill has increase by 1
Your Athletics skill has increased by 1
For practicing your whole-body reflexes you have gained 1 AGI

Several hours of Racquetball gets me an AGI point, even doing that for that long starts to make people wonder, so now I’m trying to do something similar at the beach with a volleyball I found. Traipsing about in the dark, I come across an abandoned half-wrecked sandcastle, yet it was pretty large and ornate for what was left. Well no one was around, so I kick it over. “Power Strike”

-4 HP (3 Deflected, 2 Resisted)

Ow, shit God damn it. No one is around watching? I vacuum up the sand into my inventory. That’s a useful trick. Someone built up the sand over several rocks, using them to fill in the interior spaces and molding the wet sand around it. So I fucking kicked a rock, with power strike. I take off my show and rub my injured toe.

Well there’s an interesting idea to give the form internal structure. I wonder if Sand Castle making is a separate skill or part of Craft Stone and Pottery? I experiment with pulling sand into and out of my inventory I made a crude figure out of sand that is lying on his back, but don’t see any skill changes or new skill prompts. Not that I would have taken a sand-castle building skill, which seems rather silly. O well, I kick a bunch of driftwood aside and head back up to the bus stop to get to the hotel to do more power napping and grinding.

Your Create Mana golem skill has increased by 1
Your Power Strike skill has increased by 1
You may gain the ‘Axes’ specialty for Melee Weapons

Huh, so inventory can be like a vacuum cleaner, almost. I used the last of my clay making golems and destroyed what was left of the log, wood chips are everywhere. The axe was louder, so there were some complaints. After the shotgun pellet and denim shreds trick, the fastest way to clean up is to lay on the floor, inventorying wood chips wherever I touch them, while I swept my inventory window though myself while doing so. Hmm, maybe I can use this to wash my clothes or shower faster.

My inventory power is strange for sure, and warrants further experimentation. For anything put in it; it cares that the item is touching me or my clothing, and the window, and that it wasn’t bolted down in some way. It’s annoyingly specific about what things are called, but it always matches exactly what is mentioned in an observe window. The only name variations on my experimental mess were ‘wood chips’, ‘wooden splinters’, and ‘my dignity’. The last one is apparently when my power went into trolling mode. Well, I’ll make that trade; I have a long night ahead.

-2 HP (1 Deflected, 2 Resisted) x10
Your Unarmed Combat skill has increased by 1
You have unlocked the ‘Butterfly and the Bee’ feature for Unarmed Combat

Power strike is strong enough to cause myself injury when I use it by punching or kicking, despite wearing gloves and boots. Of course it is, I learned that from the sand castle rock. Unarmed Combat has came to a dead stop at level 5. There are no more gains to be had from shadow boxing or hitting inanimate objects. It won’t surprise me if that happens with Melee Weapons also.

Enough grinding, I can do more studying on the bus and train rides to the Day Labor hang-out. I hope to catch Miguel there. Although I do not have to ask him in particular, he has the highest relationship on my sheet, and I got good vibes from him.

Miguel is there and agrees. He’ll pretend to be a guardian and help me buy a bus ticket. But, he can’t do it until Wednesday. That means I need the hotel for a couple more days, which means stealing more clothes to sell to thrift shops to afford it. I consider sticking around and doing another bout of work as a day laborer, but I can make just as much in far less time with some excessive shoplifting.

The men that had gotten beaten up aren’t here, not that I expect them to be. The group has definitely heard about what happened, it hasn’t been the first time. The consensus is that any who were non-citizens and well enough to avoid it probably won’t go to the police out of fear. My other questions only reveal the day laborers here don’t visit PHO and Potter’s involvement in an attempt to save those men is unknown. That’s disheartening. Maybe I really should get online and tell my side of the story, so long as I do it carefully. At least I got some practice in working CHA, Speech and Observe.

There’s little else to do here. I agree to meet Miguel here again early Wednesday morning. I can return to the hotel, do my shopping, and grinding before finally leaving this city.

For dutiful study of important information you have gained 1 INT
Your Meditation skill has increased by 1

Back at the hotel, using more padding, I alternated draining off Stamina with unarmed power strikes, and studying while meditating. I’ve been neglecting meditation too long recently. I haven’t even been using the chanting effect which increases the regen rates because I had been stuck in a house practicing while pretending to sleep, so I had to be quiet. I don’t skip that anymore, because now it doesn’t matter.

The punching bag I stole and filled with beach sand was leaking. I need to inventory window sweep everywhere to make sure I get my deposit back. I duct tape the bag back up but I won’t be able to keep doing this in my room for much longer. At least it‘s still late in the morning and the TV is drowning out the sound, in between power naps. I still need to train more in a place that has more room to move around. I want to reach AGI 10, so I head to the rec center again, inventory just short of being overloaded to the point of not being able to run.

Your Observe skill has increased by 1
For testing the limits of your endurance and vitality, you have gained 1 CON
+110 XP, Find the shortest path to the cheese! You have trained 4 stats simultaneously.

Well that’s unexpected. I forgot about that quest. Five hours of overloaded racquetball, worked STR, CON, AGI and PER trying to keep track of that stupid ball. I get a CON point even though I was aiming for an AGI point, not that I don’t want another CON point and that it wasn’t close, but AGI progress is still less than half way there. It’s been the exploiting of power draining Stamina and converting it to CON training that cheeses that. Why can’t I find something like that to work on the other stats? At least I can train several at the same time, the punching bag in my inventory keeps my weight at just enough encumbrance to get partial training in STR, although it’s less efficient at STR training than more focused weight lifting, but I can’t beat the double duty.

That’s all I can do here. Can’t use the same gyms too much for long stretches or people will wonder how I’m managing to work out for such a long time. Need to get back to the library or a wi-fi place and get back on PHO.

    Potter is currently wanted for questioning for his involvement in the incident yesterday, and two prior incidents, including unregistered vigilantism.

@UlteriorMotives01, It's people like you who let people like them get away with this shit.It's just another example of woefully disparate class warfare, and just like what angrybeavers said, Nothing get done unless it negatively affects the pocketbooks of the 1%.

The world is unfair enough without additionally ignoring and not correcting the rampant inequality that continues to persist. you don't deserve either your high horse or to be spewing your poisonous propaganda.

But if we actually stand together against this we can make a difference!

You tell me not to bring my politics into this thread and then you spent the last several pages spouting off yours?

And just because I want some things enforced doesn't mean I support what they are doing. I see you have completely ignored, yet again what I actually said in my post. Here let me bold it for you.

    'Asaault on minorities', that's code for someone busting up illegals. Now I don't advocate any kind of assault, but there are some legitimate complaints. The economy of great nation has been in shambles for decades.continuing to bring in a bunch of refugees and illegal immigrants that take all our jobs is just making things worse.

    We need to make America great again.

Any kind of violence is wrong, but last I checked we still had the right to free speech so I'm going to exercise it whereever the hell I want to.

I mean seriously, don't let my white maleness give you a trigger event.

Okay wow, didn't expect that much political drama unfolding in a thread about me,

Yes me. I'm the cape. I (obviously) made an account just for this posting once I saw what going on, and so I can tell my side of the story.

Don't believe me? Here is a video of me in the costume I was wearing at the time of "the incident", controlling a few snakes, and holding up a sign with the current time, date and this PHO username.

[VIDEO]

Potter...wasn't the cape name I would have gone with but whatever.

Oh and don't waste time asking questions about my power, I'm not going to answer them. I will say I'm not one of the scary masters, I can't do anything to people, just clay.

Alright my side of the story.

I became aware of prior incidents in which this minute man group (or gang now), whatever it is that they have now become, has been beating up (yes mostly immigrant) day laborers at various times in the past.

I got a tip that it was happening again, and rushed to the location to try and do something to help. I only wished I could have gotten there sooner, maybe some of those men would not have gotten hurt so much if I had.

I was the one who called 911.

As further proof: This is a transcript of my 911 call as best as I can recall it. (since as far as I know it has not been released yet)

    “911, what’s your emergency”

    “Eight gangers beat up five day laborers around Milby and McKinney Street, in some occluded park area near a train yard. They’re gonna need medical attention.”

    “Are you currently safe?”

    “The eight dudes are still there, armed with bats and clubs, yelling something like that sounds like ‘dey terk er jerbs’”

    “We have units en-route, move away to a safe area. I need your name and—“

    “HEY!”

    “Oh shit, I’ve been spotted…”

Yeah it ended there, because as it said I was spotted. I was not even aiming to get into a fight (there were alot of gangers). I called it in as an assault because at the time there were no capes present other than myself, otherwise I'd have called the PRT.

Because I got spotted though, I had to defend myself, especially after they started shooting at me! I did my best to both subdue the gangers and get the injured men to safety. that however was also interrupted. I told (the victems) I was there to help, but that was about all I had time for before we were getting shot at again, and everyone scattered. Given the circumstances some of those men are in, it would not suprise me if they are wary of speaking to the cops though.

I'm not too enthused at doing so either because when the cops did arrive, they arrested me. I was the one who called them in, I was the one trying to help, and I was the one that got arrested? that's complete bullshit.

I didn't resist, I didn't 'escape', but when Sparky showed up and started blasting cop cars, one of which I was in. because I didn't feel like getting exploded, I removed myself from that situation like any rational person would have. So I'm not a villain.

I don't know why Sparky then tried to go after me, but he did try to kill me, so I hope he chokes to death on a bag of dicks.

End of Page. 1, 2, 3 ... 7, 8, 9

4 of 5 events achieved for Quest: Become a Cape!

Wait a minute. What? I literally just hit reply to that thing. Even with the internet it should have taken at least a few seconds for that to have triggered, not instantaneously, possibly longer with the proxy hop I’m using. Post doesn’t even show any views yet so wtf? Well, shouldn’t complain too much, now I just need one more event for the sweet XP, and then I can ditch that persona and it’s throw away account.

I need to go shopping again, and sell enough clothes and stuff before the thrift and pawn stores close to pay for my stay through to Wednesday morning. Then I can try grinding again at a different 24-hour fitness place.

-1 HP (3 Deflected, 2 Resisted) x41

Well at least that’s something. Still don’t like not having my HP maxed out. I can’t get damage from power strike anymore. Shoplifting is also getting shit gains for Thievery too, but at least I can pay off my stays. I’m back at the hotel again. I’ll have to put off my AGI grinding for later tonight, after more rounds of power nap exploiting.

Tuesday February 23rd, 2010

A mess of sand and 354 power strikes later, I’m still not at level 10 Power Strike. The gains to CON from stamina loss is trickling to a crawl, but hasn’t stopped. It’s midnight when I’m done cleaning. It’s been six hours, I can check PHO again at the 24 burger joint that has wi-fi, and see what the fallout from my post is.

Hey wow, so he pops into his own thread. Looks like he has a verified cape tag now too.

I know you said no questions about but come on! You see the need for good PR, so having a back and forth can only help. Is the PRT guesses even accurate? You say clay, so I guess ceramics of all kinds? Is that like just an animate object type of deal? I wonder how large or how many things could be done at once. Also why snakes and figurines? Why not bigger stuff? I don't know anything about pottery though so maybe there are some limitations, but powers tend to tell those kind of limitation to screw off amiright?

anyway before I ramble too much it was good to hear your side of the story. I think that was a good move on your part. And no, as far as I'm aware I haven't heard of any released 911 transcript about that night yet either, though I bet there are some inquiries now.

I won't ask about the touchy subjects of trigger events, but it would be nice to know if your local to Houston or Texas, or just passing through. Have you been a cape long? An inquiring public wants to know.

Well I don't know how much Potter knows about clays and ceramics personally, but if his power only animates existing things there will be an inherent limit to the size of any clay object that can be made and you can't really make them solid clay and be fired.

The first limitation is the size of the kiln you would need. Now there are some large industrial sized kilns. These are what stoneware companies use to mass produce your various types of tableware and such. But those are designed with trays and shelves and such, and automated into an entire assembly line.

Furthermore you can't make large pieces where the clay has a huge amount of thickness because it will not dry out properly, resulting in cracks and internal fractures that weaken the final product. Now I have no idea if his power fixes those issues or what it does to add unnatrual 'flexability' and 'durability'

So anything large limited by kiln size as well as thickness issues is going to be looking at air drying. That is something that can take a long time, even in the middle of our inland dry Texas summers.(The excessive humidity around Houston will be a problem) So anyway some clay types will be far better suited to air drying that others.

If I were him, I'd research as much as I can about various clay and ceramics and the different properties they can have.

♦ Private message from Tin_Mother:

Tin_Mother *New Message*: Well, after doing some research I've confirmed the video you posted isn't faked and the 911 transcript matches up with what some of my Houston contacts have on file.

I've gone ahead and given you a Verified Cape tag. Also note I made some mostly non visible edits to the video file you posted, stripping out meta data, and put in some extra blurring around your facial contours and shifted your eye color.

You were smart enough to keep your voice out and stay well costumed. Your average person and even villain would not be able to get any identifying traits out of that but that might not be so for some Tinkers and Thinkers. It's better to be safe than sorry.

Note that what you did is not how most capes pursue the verification process. You could have probably provided much less if you had sent a private message to our staff seeking the verified cape status tag.

I do encourage you to come into the Protectorate and answer whatever questions they have.

♦ Private message from Olympus:

Olympus *New Message*: I'd like to say I very much disagreed with how the Houston PD chose to handle the situation you were involved in the other day.

The Protectorate would still like to get a statement from you about this and two prior incidents that you may have been involved in.

Doing so would be a simple formality, to allow you to give your side of the events in question, as well as give you a chance to go over procedures and the registration process for independent Heroes or even Rogues.

I also strongly encourage joining the Protectorate or the Wards. New capes trying to go it alone often don't last a full year. We can provide all kinds of support and training for you and the pay is not bad either.

The Protectorate Office which handles new capes and general inquiries is located in suite 101, at 321 Market Avenue

You can also contact them directly at 713 555-9678

Hmm, Tin_Mother…. primary board moderator. Okay wait. She sent me that less than an hour after I posted as The_Potter. I already know doing so tripped a cape event tag instantaneously. How did she have enough time, to verify my video was not fake, edit it according to whatever it was she claims to have done, and verify the 911 transcript? That’s just weird or super-efficient. Hell is the mod a cape? Well, you know, I’d do that. I’ll download her edited version of my video and compare it against the original to see exactly what changed, just to learn what to do if she is being genuine.

Well, well, is that you Sparky? Sparky… such a lame ass name. Heh, my bad. I think I recall telling the PRT that was what you called yourself, guess they decided to go with it.

Of course you might instead be just some rando noob trying to make a pathetic attempt to troll me.

Well. I have a hell of a lot I need to prepare for and limited time to do so. More shopping, hooray for 24 hour Wal-mart. Have to get the rest in the morning. Need more sand to fix up that punching bag again, more grinding, upload the edited video to my interface, work on my computers & software, check PHO again. Wonder if I’ll have time to try grinding AGI again. Glad I need very little sleep tonight.

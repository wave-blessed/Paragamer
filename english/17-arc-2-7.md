I awoke but kept Spider-Bong active. An exposure therapy session while bathing, then looked up stuff before anyone got up or I was told not to because I was grounded. So, what the hell are multi-triggers?

‘Grab-bag’ capes, often displaying three or more related minor powers, come from multi-triggers. Individuals involved in the mutual trigger event have an array of minor powers that share a concurrent theme. Said powers often complement each other or work in similar ways.

It was scant information, but I definitely had a slew of minor powers. Does that mean Julia has similar powers? I don’t have any electric-like power, if those shocks of hers were an example. It’s more than what I knew before, and Parahuman Lore went up a bit.

I hadn’t reviewed that Cape database feature at all. I saw numerous entries, all based on ones I had encountered, seen, seen pictures of, read or heard about. The numbers I had actual encounters with were smaller. Rappel, Granite, Sparky, Lifeline, Gatling, even Eidolon, for that very brief moment I saw him, and Julia. Julia was not technically a cape though. Isn’t that a designation for when you put on a costume and make your debut as a hero or villain? There it was ‘Cape Status: Not-debuted.’ More concerning, Julia was the only one with a name and photo sitting in the section representing civilian ID. Where did the photo come from? It looks like how she looked yesterday. Did my power grab it out of my FRAPS recording? ‘Powers: unknown, suspected: electric shocks, level drain’, ‘PRT ratings: unknown’…

That each entry for Parahumans had a very thorough dossier was disconcerting. Sure a lot was blank and listed as unknown, but still. The fact it had entire sections split between civilian and cape, and known vs. unknown/speculated was mind boggling. I blew through several uses of Parapedia until I realized I could do this whenever, and should use the computer for stuff I didn’t want seen before folks woke up.

I contemplated waiting before sending Julia an email, but decided it led to silly cliché mental drama. If I was going to follow her, I need to know an address or a phone number or something.

‘Hey, it’s Simon. So New Hampshire huh? Whereabouts? Obviously don’t have a number yet, phone still isn’t fixed, and the Beckett’s took it from me while I was ‘grounded’. Send me an email after you get settled in, so we can keep in touch.’

Given how late at night her plane must have arrived to get to New Hampshire she might not even be awake yet. All I could really do was wait.

At breakfast I learned that Janet wouldn’t be at school because the now defunct Galveston ISD gave diplomas to all of their former seniors; to relieve displacement congestion or something.

First period Spanish, I share it with Rachel and we were sat and grouped together, (being new transfers.) for assignments. Casual chat got a couple relationship points. The class is Spanish I, though the teacher thinks I could have been in Spanish II, but my reading and writing (of Spanish) needs work. I was stuck at skill level 3 because I no longer got skill gains from merely listening to Spanish, but did from speaking, reading and writing it. I got minor quests for Spanish homework but not for the textbook.

Art wasn’t as free form as I’d hoped. Yes they have clay and have done pottery, but not currently. Teacher wanted the basics out of the way first, so a lot of drawing. Whatever, I’ll just make Golem designs. At least I got steady skill gains, I skipped a drawing specialty once before, maybe I can re-get it.

Third period was English. It was just as useless as History, though Melissa from the house was in my class. Seats were already assigned so I wasn’t near her. Basic Academics did not rise, nor had it for Spanish and Art, but at least they increased other skills. I kept grinding Artistry by doodling all over my textbook covers. I got a piddling quest for homework but no textbook quest.

Last period was Geometry, and I sat with Rachel again. It was easy; I already had a specialty in Geometry in Mathematics skill. This wasn’t what I thought would happen. Mathematics at least went up. By the end of class I was 50% toward skill level 2. But if all I’m doing is geometry, how can I game getting more specialties? I got a minor homework quest again, and a textbook. No textbook quest though because it was fucking identical to Julia’s.

Apart from boring classes, I made a lot of ‘acquaintances’. That Good first impression feature netted me a +6 relationship boost due to CHA 12 with anyone I didn’t botch it on, and since I averaged an additional gain of 1-4 relationship with basic introductions and impressions, I was getting about 25% into the next category right off the bat. Still don’t know what that really means yet, but my power in general conform to numbers going up is good, down is bad.

While getting more friends to complete that quest is good, if it takes the same time it took for Julia, I don’t know if I want to bother. If I plan on leaving, running off or whatever, why invest in people here? There will be people in New Hampshire too. Well, maybe Rachel, I’m nearly halfway there already, and maybe some of the other kids in the house, except Thomas, fuck him.

Otherwise I got near 300 uses of Observe on students and teachers. Oh and semi-sub vocalization works for verbal commands. Why hadn’t I tried that before? Not true sub vocalization, I still have to move my tongue and larynx enough to actually hear distinct words in my inner ear. I also have to breath out through my nose to push air though my vocal chords, so it requires more than merely saying it silently in my head, but at least I can do so with my mouth shut. Maybe ventriloquism isn’t a skill or I’d have gotten it by now; although, I was explicitly not trying to be loud.

As before, I’m keeping a tally of stat scores, to try and get a guess as to what an average value is. I can only see STR, AGI, CON and CHA as base scores. The rest are still hidden. So far STR is still averaging 14 for women, 16 for men, 15 together. AGI is also around 15, without major deviations in the sexes. CON has averaged higher, maybe 16 or 17, but is far more varied. Again, no major deviations in the sexes. CHA was varied also, but was averaging around 14 for men and 16 for women. Some of the ‘popular’ kids were getting into the 20s. One thing I have to keep in mind is that my sample size is small and currently teenagers aged 14-18, which is gonna skew some numbers.

I was at least making slow gains in stats. It cost me 2 MP via Parapedia for each check, but INT and CHA has been making slow gains, since in school I basically just study and talk. LUC did go up at some point by 0.05% but I’ve no damn idea why. PER went up in tiny amounts, and only when I was actively concentrating on it in some manner. Usual this occurred via deliberate attempts to filter out noise and listen to a distant conversation, or things of that nature, and it was hard to do other stuff at the same time. PER was not going to be an easy stat to train.

Meditating on the bus or in the car was becoming a regular thing, unless I was talking to Julia; Rachel now I guess. I still dropped out of it a lot, but less often. At the counselor’s meeting, I got my usual skill and stress point gains. Another exposure therapy of Chupacabra videos, different ones this time, pushed me further along. It was easier this time, and I recorded it again, but I was going to start hitting diminishing returns. Hopefully I can max out Gamer’s Mind first.

You’d think Meditation would give me stress point gains, but nothing so far. It was taking way too damn long to get gains, and it didn’t make sense as to why. Therapy wasn’t going to last forever. I asked my consultable expert, advice from the doc was…clinical. Methods of generic stress relief: relaxation/mediation (was trying the latter), maybe certain foods, (worth looking into), massage, physical contact with someone you trust. You mean Hugs? Yeah, or sex. (I wish)

Point is, ‘natural’ Stress point regen is way to slow, meaning some kind of outside factors have to be the primary recovery method. Or maybe mine just sucks. I still can’t see raw Stress point values in Observe so can only take guesses. My max has been going up with each gain in INT or WIS, along with the difference in Stress points, but that doesn’t actually get me closer to the max. It would be nice if I can top it off before the broken arm effect expires in February, so I can finish off that ‘get healthy’ quest. That and I know how stressed Julia still was when she left, even if I succeeded my ‘help her recover’ quest, I’d like to know how to do more when I see her again.

****​

I was still pissed off at the Beckett’s once home. I refused to talk to them, just did my homework for trifling XP and studied the Earth science textbook. I woke Spider-Bong up early, before meditating for the night, because despite blowing a lot of MP on Observes today, a lot was getting wasted.

I need more mana skills. I made another attempt at summoning mana into my hand behind the shed in the backyard. Once again, nothing happened and I gave up. I should pursue some more new skills in general, since my INT raise got me more free slots. I still want to keep some for weird special skills though. Observe and Create Mana Golem, came from interactions with Parahumans, Julia and Granite. Maybe I can get more if I meet more, but my current living situation entirely restricts that.

Although I‘d made progress in many skills, I hadn’t leveled any. Hopefully I’ll do better tomorrow.

Thursday, January 14th, 2010

Fuck, wasn’t paying close enough attention, I woke up at max MP. That means I wasted some gains while asleep. I’m not even going to turn off Spider-Bong today and see how far I get.

I pushed myself during my ‘exposure therapy’ session this morning, enough to annoy the others that wanted to use the bathroom, but I was past caring. It was just enough to level up Gamer’s Mind.

I paid attention in Biology because I presumed it was allowing me to make progress in its textbook quest. But History was another waste that I spent doodling to gain a level in Artistry (no specialty, yet.) Health again was positive for gains in Basic Academics and presumed progress on its textbook quest as well. PE was… a chance to exhaust all my stamina, and finish off a level in Athletics that I had already screwed up, because as I suspected, when I hit level 4 I didn’t get the chance for a specialty. I abruptly stopped all my exercise to at least try not to ruin the next specialty, and had gained a little of Gamer’s Body. The coach was annoyed at me but it was nearly the end of class.

Throughout my day, I tried to snatch moments of practicing meditation, stealth and Observe. I got it to level 11 and stopped. What Observe specialty to go for next? This time I would need 1050 minimum unique uses of the skill on the target specialty. Animals and plants were the only feasible ones, and living in suburbia wasn’t going to let me get that many unique animals, unless I visited the zoo, so plants it is.

Meditation and stealth were difficult, and I was starting to think it wasn’t worth trying due to inefficiency. At least Meditation was still working ok on the bus rides, and stealth in the mornings before everyone got up. I did manage to level up in Create Mana Golem from having Spider-Bong active, but after level 4, the gain rate slowed to a trickle. Not that it was fast before, but I should make another one to see if that will be better, assuming I can afford materials to make it with. I’d be capable of 40 lbs. now, maybe 50 by the time I get the chance to try.

****​

I put Spider-Bong to sleep before I left and meditated during the car ride to the CPS office. I had requested our meeting to be there instead of at the Beckett's, so I could talk shit about them. Sitting there with my thoughts, I realized I’d been ignoring my Speech skill. I stopped using it because I wanted to pursue another specialty, but hadn’t thought of any. I had Persuasion and Deception. What are typical social skills of a lot of Video Games and RPGs? Classics were Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Intimidate, Languages, Gather Information, etc. Some of those were already covered. What other possibilities? Barter, Taunts, Acting, Flattery, Comedy, Oration, Flirting, Seduction? Better question is which ones won’t get me in trouble? That excludes a lot.

“…so you’re not happy because they grounded you and you can’t go out and do things. They are acting as your legal guardians on behalf of the state. And you did leave without asking twice now.” Mrs. Pearson went on after I said my rant.

“No, I told them both times, and I did ask, they just said no despite it was being a perfectly reasonable request.” I repeated, even though I had explained it before. It seems I wasn’t much getting anywhere with Mrs. Pearson in this topic. I considered using Speech on her, but I wasn’t even sure if it would succeed, and it would spoil a specialty attempt again.

We otherwise talked about how I was getting along with the other kids, how I was settling into school and other minute crap. Otherwise this was just me looking around and learning where the office was. I had FRAPS going for the whole trip. I used my camera to watch her log in and look at my record info on the computer, because I wanted to see it. Little had changed.

“So, any progress on finding my identity or anyone that knows me yet?”

Mrs. Pearson let out a small expression of defeat. “No, I’m sorry nothing has come up yet, though I must admit I have been busy and has less time available to put into it than I would like.”

“It’s been about three weeks now?”

“If you’d prefer I can keep trying or submit requests to the Social Security Administration to get the process started for assigning you a new SSN, though that on its own while take a while as well.”

“How long does that take?”

“Getting a replacement SSN card, about 10 days, but that’s when you already have a number. New numbers with pre-existing identification can be a couple weeks. Since you don’t any to begin with I imagine it will be more complicated.”

Hmm, would I even still be here by then, should it matter? “When do we meet again?”

“Tuesday the 26th.”

“Keep trying, I’ll decide then based on if you find anything yet. I think I’d prefer to meet in your office again too, instead of the house.”

“Do you have any other concerns?”

“Where did Julia move to?”

“Simon, we’ve been over this before, I can’t give out other children’s contact information.”

So, it’s not an ‘I don’t know’ but an ‘I can’t tell you’ response. “She told me New Hampshire, but she didn’t even have the exact address when she left.”

“Well, she can tell you the rest herself when she gets settled in.”

“That will be a bit difficult when I don’t have a phone because they locked it in the safe and won’t let me go to a store to get it repaired,” and so we went in a circle again. “Did you at least mark it on my inventory?”

“I’ll make a note of it. Now if there is nothing more….”

“Doctor still recommended physical therapy, but I can’t go to the Gym anymore because I am grounded.” I left out that I also ran out on my free trail. “And the psychiatrist said I should try getting accumulated to pools/open bodies of water and eventually immersion and swimming to get over my issues with having the Leviathan nearly drown me. Again, something I can’t do in current circumstances. I consider it a failure to provide medically recommended care.”

“I’ll take that into consideration, but do you understand the difference between recommended and necessity?”

I shrugged. “Does it matter?”

“Alright I am taking you back to the group home.”

“Oh and I’m getting low on pain pills again.”

****​

At the house, I spent the rest of the evening Observing trees and weeds and crap while stealthing in the backyard until I got yelled at to come in for dinner. Then it was homework again and lights out. I woke Spider-Bong up early again, to be active while meditating. Restricting Observe to plants wasn’t quite the MP drain I’d want tomorrow so I wanted to get at close to Zero MP as possible before sleeping.

Friday, January 15th, 2010

I woke and decided to keep Spider-Bong active all day to see how far I’d get. If it can last all day, then I could keep one golem, active all the time. It’s a definite incentive to make a larger, stronger golem save for the fact that it would be heavy and not easy to lug around. Of course, that only applied to civilian ID; otherwise I’d just order it to follow me around. Here I am thinking about a cape life, there is that stale cape quest I have. Just trying to find the time to pursue it hasn’t ben viable.

Another round of Mind whammy got less gains than before. Using stealth inside the house before everyone got up, got me a level up. Checking the computer, I saw no replies from Julia. Did get a reply from the repair shop, part came in yesterday. I just couldn’t do anything about it yet.

I contemplated whether or not I should break into the safe. I’d already made it past the door before, and was pretty sure I knew the combo from watching it via camera mode. That would be risky though. Taking it would make things worse. I was grounded for two weeks, I’ll see if they give it back to me. If not, then I’ll steal it back. I’ll need to figure out how to hide it though, my money also.

    A Smuggler’s Mind.
    Figure out a way to hide a cellphone, cash, and other small items on your person or belongings so that they are not found despite being searched.

    Time Limit: None
    Success: 250 XP.
    Failure: They find it, it gets taken, ???



Um, wouldn’t the answer to that be ‘Inventory’ which I still don’t have access to yet? Or was that just a tease you troll! Fine whatever, I’ll have to think of something the hard way. It will give me something else to do while doodling in English class.

It was an ‘A’ day again, Spanish, Art, English, Geometry. Skill gains, and relationship bumps, were similar to Wednesday. I gained level 2 in Mathematics. I was right, no specialty. If Geometry is a specialty, what else can be a specialty? I want to exploit this one too.

What was more interesting, was my explicit experimentation on practicing Speech skill purely by flirting. It was either that or Comedy, if either are even usable as specialties. Flirting at least could potentially help make progress on the ‘get a date’ quest. It was interesting because, I sucked at it, but at least was getting better, as I saw the skill percentages rise. Sometimes I got some relationship bumps, sometimes losses, no actual dates, though I didn’t directly ask. Also, a few jealous boyfriends shoved me or punched me in the shoulder. Hey, at least I gained a smidge of Gamer’s Body with a few lost HP. I wonder if I should feel bad, because I’m not really being genuine, they are just practice for me. Hopefully CHA is going up too, but can’t check with Parapedia while stuck on plant-watch.

We had counseling again today. More mind whammy exposure therapy that was having less effect. The Doc thought that was good, but no chances to use a pool to get to the bigger issues. More Psych and Empathy gains, and stress point recovery. Alas, I wasn’t going to get multi-days a week anymore. State insurance only allocated a limited number of sessions, and he wanted to space them out more. I was put on a once a week schedule, starting next Wednesday.

A major reason the sessions were granted at all, besides the survivor’s trauma, was the whole amnesia thing. That was something that I and these sessions had made zero progress in. It hadn’t even helped in the ‘learn more about yourself’ quest. All those insights came outside of the sessions. The only possible progress was that the psychology profession, the concept of sessions and a number of other things felt familiar. I might have had therapy in the past, and that was what I was maybe remembering or was finding familiar, or maybe I knew someone that worked in the industry. I had started off my new life with a level 1 in Psychology after all, it had to have come from somewhere, but the exact reason remained unknown.

I kept Spider-Bong awake until 5pm, when I was about to head home from counseling. I shut him off with 68 MP to spare, enough to wake him later. Even if I had started that day at max (2000) MP that would have only netted me a little more than 16 hours.

Homework and chores for minor XP, reading textbooks, meditation and off to bed. It was getting routine, grindy, and boring.

Saturday & Sunday, January 16th & 17th, 2010

I ‘slept in’ Saturday morning. I was close to my next level in Meditation and did that until I got it, which took about an hour. I was tempted to continue meditating even more. I was one level away from 10, and should get a new feature then, but it would probably take several hours, and I had shit to do.

Everyone else was sleeping. I practiced stealth around the house and warred with myself as I stared at the office door. Too risky, I went back upstairs to the computer. No email response from Julia, though I fired one off to the phone repair place. I hoped to get it next week or the week after. Should I buy just the part and try to fix it myself?

What was my long term goal? To go to where Julia was and be a cape. To achieve that, I needed to know where I was going, transportation, communication, and preparation. What were my short term goals? To max out the Gamer’s skills, Mind, Body, Interface, achievable with grinding or level ups. Interface was closest, but was stagnant. Parapedia, my main (very slow) way of increasing it, was unavailable while I was stuck Observing plants. I had not even used Observe yesterday, I was focused on raising the Golem skill. Gaining actual levels may be easier for those. Smuggler’s Mind is doable, and the Earth Book one is nearly done, but they won’t earn me a level by themselves.

I did my mind whammy session in the bath, and an attempt to recover stress points. Then I sat outside in the cold January air to meditate while spamming Observe at the neighbor’s flowers, bushes and trees and what not. Observe specialties really do suck. Animals are going to be the last one. I wish I could move my camera and meditate at the same time, but the hand movements break me form the trance, so I have to position my camera first, then turn mediation back on and Observe everything from that point, and repeat the process, over and over again. What were those plant zoos called? I got yelled at to come inside for breakfast.

After breakfast I was annoyed so decided to be annoying, and let loose my inner troll. “Hey Mrs/Mr. Beckett. Can I go to the Conservatory? No? Can we go? No? How about the Arboretum? The Zoo? The Mall? Can I go to the gym? Can I go jogging? The Library? The Hardware Store? Sorry didn’t mean to be annoying, just you know, bored is all, very bored. Do my homework? I did already last night. Can I go to the store? The Arcade? How about Miniature Golf? Go-cart racing? Go watch TV, actually I can’t. you grounded me remember? Computer, you also barred that from me to. Oh chores.. no I can’t mow the lawn, it’s January, and I have a broken arm. Trash is already on the curb. Oh Vacuum? Sue but I bet that will piss off everyone who is trying to watch TV which I cannot do since I am grounded, but if you insist…”

“Ah yes, Mr. Beckett did not appreciate the interruption of the basketball game with the noise of the Vacuum, and told me to stop. So, can I go…yes I can get the fuck out of the house, that’s perfect I’ll be at the park, is that okay? Good? Fine. I guess you can call me when you want me back, oh no wait, you can’t. My phone is broken and you took it. Fine, whatever, I’ll be back by lunch.”

Thank god. That only took about two hours of constant pestering to break them down. I walked out the front door a bit triumphant. Problem was lunch was not actually too far away, so I really didn’t have enough time to go anywhere beyond the nearby park. I could have jogged but walked, I didn’t want to contaminate another athletics specialty level.

    Secret Quest: Circumvent your grounding.
    You got them to cave at least temporarily by being a complete ass-troll. Bravo! Will it work more than once? (Quest reward is one time only)

    Success: +400 XP, loss of relationship with Andrea and Richard Beckett.



Wow, that was totally worth it then.

The park had a pond, some tiny tree clumps, a creek, a playground, and the picnic tables I first awakened Spider-Bong at. I had avoided the pond and creek the last time I was here, because of Chupacabra the fuck-face. I got my fill spamming Observe as I traipsed around the pseudo-woodland patch and clumps of overgrowth near the pond and creek. Then I started getting a lot of repeat species without gains and stopped. I tried to climb a tree one-handed and fell on my ass before I really got started. No climbing specialty yet, that was probably stupid. At least I did not actually get any athletics gain to spoil it. I should try something else.

I got a mind whammy by standing on the pier over the pond. Sure as fuck was bigger than a bathtub. I forced myself to take off my shoes and dangle my feet in. Dumb for anyone else, it still January and cold, but ‘All-weather friend’ let me give mother nature the finger sometimes. Well, let’s get this over with. I made my Chupacabra playback videos as big as I could and pushed them out in front of me over the water. Then I threw a rock at the fucker’s face, with my good arm. It was cathartic so I threw another, and another and another. Then I went and got a pile more after I ran out and did it again. Each rock pierced my illusory interface window and splashed into the water below. Moving target practice, bitch! Does that count as a creative use of my fucking interface you fucking troll?

Who should I be pissed at more? You, whatever the fuck you are behind my power or him? One of the banes of this miserable world who made me trigger and have you get stuffed into my head! Shitty or wonderful, I can’t even remember what my life was before this. But it was mine, why did the two of you have to take it from me? I promise one of you bitches is gonna pay, somehow.

    Endbringer Killer.
    Directly contribute to the death or termination of an Endbringer.

    Time Limit: Before you die.
    Success: 250,000 XP, fame and adoration, the ire of the remaining ones, ???
    Failure: Death, with no-reloads, bitch, Game Over Man, Game over.



Fuck you, an Endbringer is only worth 250k XP? Bullshit. Wait, are there actually re-loads or are you just trolling me again?

I kept throwing rocks to vent my frustration until I stopped because it was nearly lunch time. Turns out I had leveled Athletics, and probably would have gone well over into the next level, but had not noticed the notification, asking me if I wanted a ‘Throwing’ specialty. I clicked yes and went home. Gamer’s Interface had made some decent gains from that, both were nearly at the next level.

I meant to practice giving commands to Spider-Bong to see if that would grant better gain that merely being awake, but got totally sidetracked looking for plants and ranting on the pier. I washed up and helped with lunch, and wondered if the raw produce we were using for salads counted as plants or mundane objects. I’d been hesitant before about using an Observe on things that could be classified either way, but at this point I didn’t care. Good news, Observing a grape bunch, a bell pepper, tomato, onion, and a head of lettuce all cost 3MP, so hopefully that was okay. I won’t find out until I am done. I should hit a grocery store produce section if I can’t visit a plant zoo. After lunch I Observed examples of the rest of the raw produce we happened to have in the refrigerator.

That 400 XP gain meant finished those other two would leave me a lot closer than before. I spent the rest of Saturday and much of Sunday, figuring out how to achieve the smuggler one, and finishing off Julia’s Earth Science textbook quest.

****​

For the smuggler one, I decide that large fat pens with small ink stems could hold a single bill wrapped up tightly around the ink stem inside the pen. For the other I did the classic, hollowed out book. Julia’s textbook, pretty damn sure she doesn’t need it anymore, and since it was literally identical to the one the school gave me it was no loss either. Just needed to make sure I didn’t mix them up. Apparently it counted for both of them, as the quest completed with a +250 XP gain.

Practicing Stealth around in the house early Sunday morning got a level up. I also noticed I had ‘Common Cold’ status effect, with a seven day timer. Crap. At least Disease Resistance started a slow trickle upwards again. I spent all day inside reading of the Earth Science textbook. I had skipped my morning Mind whammy, because I was cutting up the geometry book, but got to it again in an extra-long bath (people complained) that afternoon. I was so close, almost at level 20 Gamer’s Mind, but it was working much less reliably each time.

    Quest Completed: Know of Earth
    Read and then successfully answer all the questionnaires in Julia’s Earth Science book.

    Success: +300 XP, Science (Earth) skill + free geology specialty, better science placement



Okay, I can gain the Science (Earth) skill. Why? That was the ??? section of the reward. Is it going to come into use? Apart from XP is that what awaits the end of the Biology and Health textbook quests? Skills are nice and all but should I be spending a slot on it? I did this already with Mathematics. The free specialty is nice sure, but grabbing those early is usually easy. Assuming I have the freedom to dedicate to it, which hasn’t always been the case. Hmm, well maybe, Earth Science and Geology will help with golems or even stone crafting? They are all rather related. Meh, I ‘ll take it since I also managed to net a +1 INT from all the study anyway, it had added another skill slot.

You would also think finding enough unique plants would be easy but I seemed to suck at it, and was wasting mana replicating species again so I stopped. I considered asking about going out again but it started raining heavily and got cold. I was stuck inside, meditating until I got bored and started the next textbook quest. Still no emails, would school this week be more productive?

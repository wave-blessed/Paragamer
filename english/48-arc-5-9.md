Stage 4: Arrivals & Departures Arc 5.9

Saturday March 6th​, 2010

I wake up, my mouth feels dry and gravelly, and there is a horrible taste in my mouth. There is a horrible burning itch on my arm, and something is poking me repeatedly in the backside. I open my eyes, and I’m greeting with the sight of dirty gritty pavement, lines of trash and a brick wall with graffiti on it, and see and feel warm daylight. And I see my own body lying face down in an alley. Someone is poking me with a stick. Free camera is on.

What the fuck?

The poking of my backside resumes and focus my camera on the assailant. Observe. the controls feel sluggish. What the fuck? Why the hell am I lying face down in some alley way with Free Camera on? I switch back to normal view and prop myself up.

“Yer alive.” A voice says as the poking stops.

I sit up and turn around. “What the fuck?” I verbally say what I have been thinking. Last thing I remember clearly was ditching my escort at the train station who insisted I wasn’t allowed to leave until my non-existent fake father picked me up. After that it gets hazy, I recall trying and failing to cabs to take me to Brockton Bay, but don’t recall why. Then I remember a fight between cliché sexy green alien, the Green Giant from those vegetable commercials, and a bunch of rejects that looked like extras from a Mad Max Movie. Did any of that happen or was it a bad dream?

Well, judging from this guy’s appearance and the shopping cart filled with odds and ends next to him, he’s some homeless dude. Reading his Observe record confirms it. He’s still holding the stick, but stops waving it around.

“Thought I found a body. It happens sometimes, especially over wintah. People on the street freeze to death sometimes.” The man says in a thick Boston accent. “Othah-wise yah be a bit young to get black-out drunk in an alleyway.”

“It’s spring. Where the fuck are my clothes?” I ask finally standing up. I was in nothing but my underwear, which felt…wet.

“If yah been here all night, folk probably stole ‘em.”

“Where am I and what day is it?” I ask fearing the worse. How long was I unconscious? How did I get unconscious and why can’t I remember what happened last night?

“Boston, it’s Saturday”

“The sixth?”

“Yeah, Coppers are on the way, called it in to the store across the way”

I do not need that extra complication. At least I’m still in the city and it’s only the next day. My inventory is still present, but… “What’s your name?” I knew it but…

“Olly.”

“Turn around close your eyes, and count to one hundred.”

“Why should I? I don’t want you taking my stuff. Coppers probably give you a blanket or such…”

I put my hand behind my back and summon a twenty from my inventory, then show it to him. “Cause I’ll give you this.”

“Where did?...”

I summon another one. “No questions, you found and saw nothing.” Olly turns around and starts counting.

I inventory the dirt and grime off myself and equip a new set of underwear and clothing. I put the two twenties under a rock where I was standing and stealth my way out of the ally. I’m in an extremely run down commercial area, filled with pawn shops, payday loan places and liquor stores. There are a mess of notifications waiting for me, but I pause just before opening them when I spot some guy wearing what looks like my costume trench coat down the street. I tag him with Observe just as he spots me and runs the other way.

I run across the street after him, but stop after I skim over his summary. It’s not worth it. I need to know what the hell happen last night. He’s just another down on his luck homeless guy that needs my coat more than I do. I can steal a better one later anyway. The burning itch on my arm comes to my attention again, and I glace down. It looks hideous. What the hell is this and where did it come from? Status Effects

Something that has a luck penalty? Fucking weird. Just what is this thing? Held at a certain angle in the sunlight, the wound on my arm glitters with a metallic sheen intermingled among the massive splotch of discolored skin that I thought was a bruise on my good arm. I can still use my arm it seems but damn is this thing itchy, distracting, and immensely uncomfortable. It hurts, but it’s a dull burning ache, more annoyance than hindrance, but that’s with the 75% pain resistance my powers give me.

Some people on the street are starting to stare, so I duck into an alley again, making sure they aren’t any surprise muggers waiting inside first. With no eyes on me, I equip a long sleeve shirt to cover the wound up and resume wandering. I find a run-down Dunkin’ Donuts and step inside. I glance at a wall clock as I head toward the bathroom. It’s near 10:15am. Unanswered notifications still pulse at me but I need to know what the hell this is, and what the hell happened last night.

I remove the shirt in the stall, Parapedia the status effects, and Observe the wound itself several times.

    Festering Wound:
    An infected wound from contact with manifested parasitic organisms. It is linked to the Exotic Parasitical Infection status effect. It is located on the surface of skin at the site of a former major bruise and contain dead and infected tissue. Deeper penetration into the body is currently blocked by the Avatar state.

    Time Remaining: 2.12:37:44

Manifested parasitic organisms? Former Major Bruise? Did it heal? It doesn’t look healed. Well this at least confirms it still only skin deep, and that Avatar is working properly regarding that. It has a timer, and doesn’t have the permanent tag, but something is wrong. The timer goes down then goes back up again, hardly making any progress.

    Exotic Parasitical Infection:
    This infection is the results of remnants of parasitic seeding attack, consisting of clusters of semi-organic parasitic motes summoned by the parasitic seeding Shard fragment. Upon skin contact they bury themselves within the victim at the site of the injury, setting off a persistent festering wound as the body attempts to fight off the infection, while attempting to spread to other areas. Infection expansion currently restricted to initial area by Avatar state and Disease Resistance.

    Time Remaining: 64.14:15:33

Shared Fragment? This meant it came from a parahuman power, like that wasn’t obvious enough from how it looks. If I got to a doctor the PRT will get called. At least it also says Avatar and Disease resistance are working, but, 64 days? Fuck that. At least it also doesn’t have a permanent tag and the timer isn’t acting weird. Also what the hell is COM? Oh right I forgot. Comfort attribute, which I turned notifications for almost everywhere. Stupid useless thing. Still these effects are cutting that stat in half alone. That fucks with my concentration and makes lots of skills harder to use.

There isn’t much else for me to do. I almost scratch at it but stop myself, and pull out some bandages from inventory. My HP is full, any fake blood, scabs or bruise voxels have long since faded. Actually are bruise voxels a thing? Maybe not, as they don’t separate off my body.

I put some OR gloves from my inventory onto my hands. The wound feels rough, but doesn’t actually seem open. Did I heal it while unconscious sealing that shit inside? If it’s not open skin why is it still called a wound? This system doesn’t make any sense! Yeah, because powers don’t make any sense.

I’m getting distracted. I wrap the ‘wound’ up. The Comfort penalty only goes down by a small amount as a result, and the Allure penalty goes away now that it is covered up by both a bandage and a shirt.

I go over my inventory. Where did all this fruit come from? Ignoring that for now, nearly everything is still present. Certainly the most important things, Julia and Nathan’s guns, Bonesaw’s brain wave thing and legless spider bot, all my tools, food and camping stuff.

No wait, my golem snakes are gone. So is my hand-axe, and my entire makeshift costume. Which if I got in a fight, I would have worn, and would have been wearing it while robbed in the alley. Were people really that desperate to steal the damn costume right off a cape? Except it doesn’t look like a costume so much as a normal clothes, boots, trench coat and motor bike pads and helmet. Fuck, of course my watch is gone too. I can’t keep that in inventory without constantly having to fix the time when I take it out. So everything not in my inventory except a pair of dirty underwear got stolen. Means I had my hand-axe and my snake golems out and lost them somehow. Definitely had to have been in a fight.

The train arrived at just before 5 pm last night, so what the hell happened to me in the last 17 and a half hours?

Looks like that’s only what happened while I was unconscious. It’s certainly not everything, and only brings up more questions. The bad taste in my mouth is still there. I wash up, head back into the Dunkin Donuts, buy a jug of chocolate milk and a half dozen. I sit at one of their tiny tables, and open up my status, notes, and FRAPS.

My notes interface catches my eye first. A new file entry titled README is next to the file I keep my power notes in.

    leave town vierw fraps got caught in fight between plant people and teetrh, captured bby blasto, hit me with spores to mmakee meee forgggggertsssttuu

Plant People? Teeth? Blasto? Who in the hell are those people? Looks like I typed that in a hurry, given the number of typos and the unfinished sentence.

FRAPS yeah, duh, I was getting to that. It’s always on, should tell me everything.

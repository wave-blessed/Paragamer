    Fuck you Potter, you attack me popele, now I know you, I know your IP I will fry your ass. I'm calling you out! Or are you too much of a coward to face me and not run like a bitch? You don't and I will find you and fry you

Well, well, is that you Sparky? Sparky… such a lame ass name. Heh, my bad. I think I recall telling the PRT that was what you called yourself, guess they decided to go with it.

Of course you might instead be just some rando noob trying to make a pathetic attempt to troll me.

So do what I did, prove who you are with video/pics or GTFO.

But on the off chace you actually are that lame excuse for a human bug zapper, I don’t recall attacking any ‘popele’, do you know what a spell checker is?

Oh and ooo, you know me cause you know my IP so you're gonna find me? Good luck, I'm behind seven proxies.

Whatever, prove who you are and we'll see. You're the one calling me out, that means I get to choose the time and place. Mano a mano unless your too chicken shit for that. Be seeing you.​

Well. I had a hell of a lot I needed to prepare and limited time to do so. More shopping, hooray 24 hour Walmart, have to get the rest in the morning. Need more sand and fix up that punching bag again, more grinding, upload the edited video to my interface, work on my computers & software, check PHO again. Wonder if I’ll have time to try grinding AGI again. Glad I need very little sleep tonight.

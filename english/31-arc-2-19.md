Your Create Mana golem skill has increased by 1
Your Power Strike skill has increased by 1
You may gain the ‘Axes’ specialty for Melee Weapons

Huh, so inventory can almost be like a vacuum cleaner. I used the last of my clay making golems and destroyed what was left of the log, wood chips were everywhere. The axe was louder, so there were some complaints. After the shotgun pellet and denim shreds trick, the fastest way to clean up was to lay on the floor, inventorying wood chips wherever I touched them, while I swept my inventory window though myself while doing so. Hmm, maybe I could use this to wash my clothes or shower faster.

My inventory power was strange for sure, and warranted further experimentation. For anything put in it; it seemed to care that the item was touching me (or my clothing) and the window, and that it wasn’t bolted down in some way. It was annoyingly specific about what things were called though, but it always matched exactly what was mentioned in an observe window. The only name variations on my experimental mess were ‘wood chips’, ‘wooden splinters’, and ‘my dignity’. The last one was apparently when my power went into trolling mode. Well, I’ll make that trade; I have a long night ahead.

-2 HP (1 Deflected, 2 Resisted) x10
Your Unarmed Combat skill has increased by 1
You have unlocked the ‘Butterfly and the Bee’ feature for Unarmed Combat

So it seems my power strike is now strong enough to cause myself injury when I use it by punching or kicking, despite wearing gloves and boots. Also Unarmed Combat gains came to a dead stop at level 5. There are no more gains to be had from shadow boxing or hitting inanimate objects. It wouldn’t surprise me if that happens with Melee Weapons also.

Enough grinding for now, I could do more studying on the bus and train rides to the Day Labor hang-out. I hoped to catch Miguel there. Although I did not need to ask him, he was the one I had the highest relationship with on my sheet, plus I got good vibes from him.

Fortunately Miguel was there and agreed. He’d pretend to be a guardian and help me buy a bus ticket. Unfortunately, he couldn’t do it until Wednesday at the earliest. That meant I need the hotel for a couple more days at the minimum, which meant stealing more clothes to sell to thrift shops be able to afford it. I considered sticking around and doing another bout of work as a day laborer, but I could make just as much in far less time with some excessive shoplifting.

The men that had gotten beaten up weren’t here, not that I expected them to be. The group had definitely heard about what happened, it hadn’t been the first time. The consensus was that any who were non-citizens and well enough to avoid it probably wouldn’t go to the police anyway out of fear. My other careful attempts at extracting info only revealed that very few of the day laborers here visited PHO and Potter’s involvement in an attempt to save those men was unknown. That was disheartening. Maybe I really should get online and tell my side of the story, so long as I do it carefully. At least I got some practice in working CHA, speech and Observe.

There was little else to do here then, I agreed to meet Miguel here again early Wednesday morning. I can return to the hotel, do my shopping, and grinding before finally leaving this city.

For dutiful study of important information you have gained 1 INT
Your Meditation skill has increased by 1

Back at the hotel, and using more padding this time, I alternated draining off Stamina with unarmed power strikes, and studying while meditating. The latter was annoying, but I had been neglecting meditation far too long recently. I hadn’t even been using the chanting effect which increases the regen rates because I had been stuck in a house when practicing, while pretending to sleep, when other people actually were sleeping, so I had to be quiet. I didn’t skip that anymore, because now it didn’t matter. However I still broke mediation at any movement greater than breathing, blinking or moving my eyes. Even gestures to control my interface interrupted it, but I could at least read. Until I needed to turn the page or use the interface controls to scroll through my downloaded stuff. That’s when I had to break and restart meditation every time, and thus why it was so annoying. Being annoying though isn’t enough to prevent the need to make my practice sessions much more efficient, so I stuck to it. My most precious resource was time. The more I could do simultaneously the better.

-0 HP (3 Deflected, 2 Resisted) x274
Your Power Strike skill has increased by 1
-1 HP (3 Deflected, 2 Resisted) x85

The punching bag I had stolen and filled with beach sand was leaking. I needed to inventory window sweep everywhere to make sure I got my deposit back. I duct taped the bag back up but I probably won’t be able to keep doing this in my room for much longer. At least it was still late in the morning and the TV was drowning out some of the sound, in between power naps that is. I still need to train more in a place that had a lot more room to move around. I wanted to reach AGI 10 before I picked a perk, so I headed out to the rec center again, inventory just short of being overloaded to the point of not being able to run.

Your Observe skill has increased by 1
For testing the limits of your endurance and vitality, you have gained 1 CON
+110 XP, Find the shortest path to the cheese! You have trained 4 stats simultaneously.

Well that was unexpected. I forgot about that quest. Five hours of overloaded racquetball, worked STR, CON, AGI and PER trying to keep track of that stupid ball. I get CON point even though I was aiming for an AGI point, not that I didn’t want another CON point and that it wasn’t close, but AGI progress is still less than half way there. It’s been the exploiting of power draining Stamina and converting it to CON training that does cheeses that. Why can’t I find something like that to work on the other stats? Maybe there is and I haven’t found it yet. At least I could train several at the same time, the punching bag in my inventory kept my weight at just enough encumbrance to get partial training in STR, although it was less efficient at STR training than more focused weight lifting, but it can’t beat the double duty.

Well that’s all I can do here. Best not to use the same gyms too much for such long stretches or people will wonder how I am managing to go work out for such a long time. Need to get back to the library or a wi-fi place and get back on PHO.

Posted on February 20, 2010:

EDIT: What we know now:
Name: Potter (PRT designation)
Sex: Male
Ratings: Master ?
Powers: Can control small animal and insect figurines of unnatrual flexibility and durability made from clay or ceremics.

    The male cape, based on what we know has been designated with the name 'Potter'. He is Master (rating pending) that can control small animal and insect figurines of unnatural flexibility and durability compared to the materials they were made from, so far being raw clay or ceremics.

    Potter is currently wanted for questioning for his involvement in the incident yesterday, and two prior incidents, including unregistered vigilantism.

Umm, what the hell does 'unregistered vigilantism mean?

/end edit

So apparent new cape gets into a fight with Sparky and Granite during an altercation that had the Houston PD out in force near my neighborhood. Though where was the PRT in this? Anyway I saw Sparky doing a lightshow, that's fucking scary, but this is about the other guy.

Word is he controlled a bunch of snakes and sicced them on some ganger redneck types then swarmed Sparky afterwards. Sparky lit the neighborhood up. Literally fucking EMP blast destroyed my phones my computer, everything electronic in our entire neighboor block

I mention this because I know its normal to ask for or post video/photo proof but that is literally impossible becausemy phone is now a brick. (posting from friend's computer, for the shit-poster that ask me how)

Anyways does anyone know anything about this guy? He ran through our aparment complex after the fight, hockey helmet, goggles, boots, giant ass fur-coat that looked all singed as hell. (Must have caught a blast from sparky?)

@UlteriorMotives01, It's people like you who let people like them get away with this shit.It's just another example of woefully disparate class warfare, and just like what angrybeavers said, Nothing get done unless it negatively affects the pocketbooks of the 1%.

The world is unfair enough without additionally ignoring and not correcting the rampant inequality that continues to persist. you don't deserve either your high horse or to be spewing your poisonous propaganda.

But if we actually stand together against this we can make a difference!

You tell me not to bring my politics into this thread and then you spent the last several pages spouting off yours?
And just because I want some things enforce doesn't mean I support what they are doing. I see you have completely ignored, yet again what I actually said in my post. Here let me bold it for you.

    'Asaault on minorities', that's code for someone busting up illegals. Now I don't advocate any kind of assault, but there are some legitimate complaints. The economy of great nation has been in shambles for decades.continuing to bring in a bunch of refugees and illegal immigrants that take all our jobs is just making things worse.

    We need to make America great again.

Any kind of violence is wrong, but last I checked we still had the right to free speech so I'm going to exercise it whereever the hell I want to.
I mean seriously, don't let my white maleness give you a trigger event.

Okay wow, didn't expect that much political drama unfolding in a thread about me,

Yes me. I'm the cape. I (obviously) made an account just for this posting once I saw what going on, and so I can tell my side of the story.

Don't believe me? Here is a video of me in the costume I was wearing at the time of "the incident", controlling a few snakes, and holding up a sign with the current time, date and this PHO username.

[VIDEO]

Potter...wasn't the cape name I would have gone with but whatever.

Oh and don't waste time asking questions about my power, I'm not going to answer them. I will say I'm not one of the scary masters, I can't do anything to people, just clay.

Alright my side of the story.

I became aware of prior incidenta in which this minute man group (or gang now), whatever it is that they have now become, has been beating up (yes mostly immigrant) day laborers at various times in the past.

I got a tip that it was happening again, and rushed to the location to try and do something to help. I only wished I could have gotten there sooner, maybe some of those men would not have gotten hurt so much if I had.

I was the one who called 911.


As further proof: This is a transcript of my 911 call as best as I can recall it. (since as far as I know it has not been released yet)

    “911, what’s your emergency”

    “Eight gangers beat up five day laborers around Milby and McKinney Street, in some occluded park area near a train yard. They’re gonna need medical attention.”

    “Are you currently safe?”

    “The eight dudes are still there, armed with bats and clubs, yelling something like that sounds like ‘dey terk er jerbs’”

    “We have units en-route, move away to a safe area. I need your name and—“

    “HEY!”

    “Oh shit, I’ve been spotted…”

Yeah it ended there, because as it said I was spotted. I was not even aiming to get into a fight (there were alot of gangers). I called it in as an assault because at the time there were no capes present other than myself, otherwise I'd have called the PRT.

Because I got spotted though, I had to defend myself, especially after they started shooting at me! I did my best to both subdue the gangers and get the injured men to safety. that however was also interrupted. I told (the victems) I was there to help, but that was about all I had time for before we were getting shot at again, and everyone scattered. Given the circumstances some of those men are in, it would not suprise me if they are wary of speaking to the cops though.

I'm not too enthused at doing so either because when the cops did arrive, they arrested me. I was the one who called them in, I was the one trying to help, and I was the one that got arrested? that's complete bullshit.

I didn't resist, I didn't 'escape', but when Sparky showed up and started blasting cop cars, one of which I was in. because I didn't feel like getting exploded, I removed myself from that situation like any rational person would have. So I'm not a villian.

I don't know why Sparky then tried to go after me, but he did try to kill me, so I hope he chokes to death on a bag of dicks.

4 of 5 events achieved for Quest: Become a Cape!

Wait a minute. What? I literally just hit reply to that thing. Even with the internet it should have taken at least a few seconds for that to have triggered, not instantaneously, possibly longer with the proxy hop I am using. Post doesn’t even show any views yet so wtf? Well, shouldn’t complain too much, now I just need one more event for the sweet XP, and then I can ditch that persona and it’s a throw away account.

I needed to go shopping again, and sell enough clothes and stuff before the thrift and pawn stores close to pay for my stay through to Wednesday morning. Then I can try grinding again at a different 24-hour fitness place.

-1 HP (3 Deflected, 2 Resisted) x41
Your Damage Resistance (Physical) skill has increased by 1
-0 HP (3 deflected, 3 Resisted)
Your Observe skill has increased by 1

Well at least that was something. Still don’t like not having my HP maxed out yet. I can’t get damage from power strike anymore though. Shoplifting is also getting shit gains for Thievery now too, but at least I can pay off my stays. I was back at the hotel again anyway. I’d have to put off my AGI grinding for later tonight, after more rounds of sleep regen exploiting.

Tuesday February 23rd, 2010

A mess of sand and 354 power strikes later, I still wasn’t at level 10 Power Strike, and the gains to CON from pure Stamina loss were trickling to a crawl, but they hadn’t stopped yet either. It was midnight when I was done cleaning. It been six hours now so I can check PHO again at the 24 burger joint that had wi-fi, and see what the fallout from my post is.

Replied on February 22, 2010:
Hey wow, so he pops into his own thread. Looks like he has a verified cape tag now too.

I know you said no questions about but come on! You see the need for good PR, so having a back and forth can only help. Is the PRT guesses even accurate? You say clay, so I guess ceramics of all kinds? Is that like just an animate object type of deal? I wonder how large or how many things could be done at once. Also why snakes and figurines? Why not bigger stuff? I don't know anything about pottry though so maybe there are some limitations, but powers tend to tell those kind of limitation to screw off amiright?

anyway before I ramble too much it was good to hear your side of the story. I think that was a good move on your part. And know as far as I'm aware I haven't heard of any released 911 transcript about that night yet either, though I bet there are some inquiries now.

I won't ask about the touchy subjects of trigger events, but it would be nice to know if your local to Houston or Texas, or just passing through. Have you been a cape long? An inquiring public wants to know.

Replied on February 22, 2010:
Well I don't know how much Potter knows about clays and ceramics personally, but if he power only animates existing things there will be an inherent limit to the to the size of and clay object that can be made and you can't really make them solid clay and be fired.

The first limitation is the size of the kilm you would need. Now there are some large industrial sized kilns.these are what stoneware comapnies use to mass produce your various types of tableware and such. But those are seigned with tray aand shelves and such, and automatic into an entire assembly line.

Furthermore you can't make large pieces wher the clay has a huge amount of thickness because it will not necessarily dry out properly, resulting in cracks and internal fractures that weaken the final product. now I have no idea if his power fixes those issues or what it does to add unnatrual 'flexability' and 'durability'

So anything large limited by kin size as well as thickness issues is going to be looking at air drying. that is something that can take a long time, even in the middle of our inland dry Texas summers.(The excessive humidy around Houston will be a problem) So anywya some clay will be far better suited to air drying that others.

If I were him, I'd research as much as I could about various clay and ceramics and the different properties they can have.

♦ Private message from Tin_Mother:

Tin_Mother *New Message*: Well, after doing some research I've confirmed the video you posted isn't faked and the 911 transcript matches up with what some of my Houston contacts have on file.

I've gone ahead and given you a Verified Cape tag. Also note I made some mostly non visible edits to the video file you posted, stripping out meta data, and put in some extra blurring around your facial contours and shifted your eye color.

You were smart enough to keep your voice out and stay well costumed. Your average person and even villain would not be able to get any identifying traits out of that but that might not be so for some Tinkers and Thinkers. It's better to be safe than sorry.

Note that what you did is not how most capes pursue the verification process. You could have probably provided much less if you had sent a private message to our staff seeking the verified cape status tag.

I do encourage you to come into the Protectorate and answer whatever questions they have.
​
♦ Private message from Olympus:

Olympus *New Message*: I'd like to say I very much disagreed with how the Houston PD chose to handle the situation you were involved in the other day.

The Protectorate would still like to get a statement from you about this and two prior incidents that you may have been involved in.

Doing so would be a simply formality, to allow you to give your side of the events in question, as well as give you a chance to go over procedures and the registration process for independent Heroes or even Rogues.

I also strongly encourage joining the Protectorate or the Wards. New capes trying to go it alone often don't last a full year. We can provide all kinds of support and training for you and the pay is not bad either.

The Protectorate Office which handles new capes and general inquiries is located in suite 101, at 321 Market Avenue

You can also contact them directly at 713 555-9678

Hmm, Tin_Mother…. primary board moderator. Okay wait. She sent me that less than an hour after I posted as The_Potter. I already know doing so tripped a cape event tag instantaneously. How did she have enough time, to verify my video was not fake, edit it according to whatever it was she claims to have done, and verify the 911 transcript? That’s just weird or super-efficient. Hell is the mod a cape? Well, you know, I’d do that. I should download her edited version of my video and compare it against the original to see exactly what changed, just to learn what to do if she is being genuine.

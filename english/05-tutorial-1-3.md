I turn to look at Julia after she placed her hand on my shoulder. Did I startle her? She has an awkward, confused look on her face and pulls her hand back. “Something in my…” I didn’t bother finished the cliché line, it was pretty obvious she didn’t believe that, so our awkward silence persisted.

For performing a repeated action you may gain the ‘Null Resistance’ skill.

What the hell is that supposed to be?

“What happen to your arm?” Julia asks, breaking the silence.

“I assume it broke when it got struck by debris that fell off the upper floor of the mall when we were hanging on Rappel’s ropes. What happen to your leg?”

“Doctor thinks it is some kind of weird electrical burn”

Images from yesterday flash through my mind again. I see the dirty sinkhole water, the falling transformer and Julia yelling to get out of the water. “How? From the water?” I pause because I don’t want to make myself or Julia go through those memories again, though I was also still very curious for more details. “Are you okay to talk about that any more? You don’t have to if you don’t want to.”

“Something like that.” Julia takes several deep breathes before continuing. “I got back to the surface after waking up from blacking out. You were only partially in the water. The wave had moved us, the debris raft, and a lot of other debris over to the wall of the sinkhole. I got you the rest of the way out of the water, you were still unconscious and tried to get myself out as well, still had one leg in the water when I felt some massive shock pain. Eidolon was there. I don’t remember him even arriving. He made some huge glowing gold cage sphere thing that encircled…Lev” Julia pauses again, going silent.

“You can stop if you want.”

Julia shook her, “Just give me a minute.” I wait it out patiently before she continues. “He lifted Leviathan and the sphere thing into the air. Leviathan was punching the thing from the inside. I could hear it cracking like thunder, even saw the cracks forming, before it was high up enough in the air that I couldn’t make out those details anymore. I guess it broke, because the sphere disappeared with a crash sound, then a whole bunch of lasers hit Leviathan and I think Alexandria slammed into him, knocking him beyond where I could see. I don’t know how the fight went after that, but after some time it ended because the sirens were turned off. You were still unconscious.”

“Thanks for pulling me out of the water then I guess”

“You pulled me out before that, onto the raft.”

“I did?”

“Yeah”

“Simon Anderson?” I hear someone call my name and look up, some nurse in scrubs is near my cot and looking around.

I stood up. “That’s me.”

The nurse walks over. “Dr. Johnson can see you in a moment, this way please.”

I turn to Julia, “Hey can you watch my stuff?”

“Okay”

“I got a jug of water on that cot over there too you can use, the one with the nasty T-shirt on it. Do you need anything?” I asked as I pointed out my cot.

“Um, I don’t know.”

“This way please.” The nurse said again, so I follow.

So just what the fuck is ‘Null Resistance’? “Skills”

    Null Resistance (WIS, LUC) (Passive): Level: 1 (0.00%)

    Allows you to resist nullifying, negating, and suppressing effects.


Um, okay sure. I’ll accept whatever the hell that is. How did that even happen?

****​

I don’t know how long it’s been, still don’t have a watch or phone. I’m in some kind of waiting area in a different, smaller tent. I still haven’t seen Dr. Johnson. The nurse or maybe it was just an assistant, said ‘wait here until you’re called’ so I am. Finally gives me a chance to go through all those damn notification options to try and reduce the spam.

I turn off all of the notifications related to gaining and losing ‘Equipment’. I turn off all status effect notifications related to Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, Hygiene, and Comfort as well. Geez these option controls are complex. I turned off the ‘OnModified’ for all the status effects I currently have. I want to know when they’re gone, so I keep the ‘OnRemoved’ and it might be important to know if they came back so keep ‘OnReceive’ too. Of course I only do this after I discover I could auto-minimize all notifications in general. That’s really useful.

After I figured out how to lessen the spam I get my first example of an auto-minimized notification. A little purple circle with the number 1 in it appears in an out of the way corner of my vision. I tap the air where it’s located and it brought up my unread notification.

Your Gamer’s Interface skill has increased by 1

When I dismiss it, the purple circle with the number on it is gone. That’s a major relief. I could live with the non-obtrusive little number in the corner of my view, along with the HP and Mana bars that were already there. I’ll be glad to have no more annoying pop-ups stressing me out.

As soon as I finish that thought, the purple circle appears again, another number 1 in it. Hmm, so it was no longer in my face, and I could at least choose to ignore it. Yet my curiosity very much still made me want to know what this new one was. How long can I resist until I choose to read it?

I lasted all of three seconds before tapping the air again to see what it was.

You have recovered 5 Stress points.

Umm, okay. Was that from regen? No, I think regen would have told me with a gain of just one point. Was learning how to get rid stupid fucking annoying pop-ups actually worth, according to my weird game quantifying power, ‘5 stress points’? This…implies, my own power is stressing me out and making me run in circles trying to figure it out. I turned the tutorial mode on, shouldn’t that have given me more clues or are the designers just sucky?

“Simon Anderson?” someone finally calls me and leads me behind a curtain where I sit on yet another cot. A different nurse or first aid worker pokes and prods me, asks me irrelevant health questions, and leads me to an x-ray machine. They X-rayed my head and my broken arm. She leads me back to the curtained cot and leaves. I wait again.

Another woman enters, there is no cliché lab coat, but her name tag identified her as Dr. Kendra Johnson, finally.

“I’m told you may have a concussion and memory loss.”

“Yeah, I can’t otherwise explain it.

She shines a pen light into my eyes to check my pupils and starts feeling my head with latex gloved hands. “X-Rays do not show any signs of skull fractures. I’d prescribe an MRI but we don’t exactly have one handy. I don’t feel or see any swelling, only a few minor scratches on your scalp. Your arm is set, but needs a proper cast. You have an impact fracture in your humerus.”

“My what?”

“Upper arm bone, I’ll have a nurse prepare a cast for you.”

“Well it hurts like hell, and all I’ve have are a couple extra strength Tylenol and they haven’t done squat.”

“I’ll prescribe a course of pain medication for you, anything else?”

“I was pulled out of that sinkhole after swimming in filth with open wounds. I may be infected with who knows what.”

“I’ll prescribe you a general course of antibiotics as well.” She then turns to scribble on a piece of paper. “Don’t lose this paper, it has your prescriptions. I’ve also recommend an MRI screening for when you get to Houston. Without any physical evidence though, I am inclined to believe your memory issues are psychological in nature. You’ve been through a lot. Everyone that has survived this attack has mental and emotional injuries as well as physical ones. You’re not alone in that. There are grief and trauma counselors on site. I advise you seek some out. If that’s all, a first aid worker will get your arm taken care of, and show you to where the medical dispensary is being set up.”

“A girl, a friend, Julia Mendez was pulled out of the sinkhole with me, was swimming in the same stuff. Her leg is banged up, and I haven’t seen her get up off her cot, she doesn’t have a crutch or anything either.”

“I will have someone check-up on her. Jessica here will see to your arm.”

And that was that. Maybe ten minutes with the good doctor and I’m ushered back out from behind the curtain and someone else's name is called. Jessica takes me to another part of the tent, takes off my sling, washes down my arm again, and starts preparing a cast. She looks tired.

“Are you a nurse? She called you a first aid worker.”

“Not a nurse, but I have advanced first aid certification. I’m a volunteer.”

I wince as pain shoots through my arm as she moves it to get the cast in place. I try to pay close attention to what she’s doing; maybe I can get a skill out of it. “How long does that take?” The unread notification counter bumped up to one. I was hopeful, but ignored it for now.

“About six hours for basic, another eighteen for advanced.”

“Can you teach me? I’d like to be more useful.”

“What, no. Too busy with all this, take a course when things get settled and your arm heals”

Another wince of pain and another unread notification incremented as a molded plastic shell was snapped into place over my upper arm. The cast was also held up by a strap that went around my other shoulder and a cuff thing on the wrist of my broken arm that hung from another strap around my neck. Jessica delivers a spiel about how to care for the injury and the cast. My arm needs to hang in place, don’t rest the elbow of my broken arm on anything; don’t drive a car using that arm, etc. Do I even know how to drive? I’m actually glad it’s not some massive plaster get-up that I wouldn’t have to get wet or something. With all that done I get booted out of the tent and directed to the ‘dispensary’ tent, which is still in the process of being set up. I show my prescription to the dude that looks like he is manning it and get told to wait till late morning or noon at the earliest before I could get anything.

I go back to the tent that had the cots to figure out what the hell else I could do with myself.

****​

To my disappointment the notifications didn’t indicate I’d gained a first aid skill, just two points of HP damage from my bone getting adjusted. I told Julia that I mentioned her to the doctor, and confirm she couldn’t walk too well on her injured leg.

I take some swigs of water and on a whim ‘observe’ the box of Cheerios.

    A box of cereal
    This is a 12 oz. box of Sack ‘n Save brand, multi-grain Flour O’s (imitation Cheerios). It is made from wheat, rice, corn, oats, millet, and various other ingredients. Read the damn box if you’re that interested.

    Contents are 66.67% full. +6 total HP per full box.


Yeah, my power definitely trolls me. My hunger bar hasn’t gone down much in the time since I last ate, I checked. It’s annoying to have lost yet more HP over something so minor even if it had hurt like a bitch, I chow down on more cereal anyway. Keep the observe window open so I can watch it self-update. The contents number keeps going down as I stuffed more into my mouth. When it get to 50%, I get a +1 HP notification. I eat more but find it difficult to do so, my Hunger bar is full. 33% remaining and another notification later, tells me I have the status effect ‘Stuffed’, which gives a comfort penalty. Really? Fucking bullshit useless minutia, however I didn’t gain more HP. I should have, if it was really going to get me +6 in total, but I only got +3 even though 2/3rds is now gone. Either it’s lied or I can’t gain HP from food if I’m already ‘full’. That sucks, I wanted exploit that shit to eat my way back to full health.

I observe the MRE and the water jug as well just because I can.

    Meal Ready to Eat
    This contains multiple packets consisting of a main entre (menu 24, meatloaf and gravy) and numerous packets for sides (crackers and dried fruit). The total weight is 16 oz.

    Contents are full. +8 total HP for entire meal.



    One US gallon jug of purified water.
    It’s water. You drink it when you’re thirsty dumbass. Total volume is one gallon / 128 fluid oz.

    Contents are full. +16 total SP.


SP? Stamina points? I’m already at max stamina, so I didn’t notice any gains from drinking water earlier.

I make sure my cot is still unoccupied and wander for a bit looking for the on-site counselors Jessica mentioned. Found some after asking around but there’s a line, so I skip it and come back.

An increasing number of people have been steadily arriving. Julia isn’t there when I return. It looks like she managed to obtain a blanket while I was wandering. My cereal box is gone? Fucking thieves, unless Julia took it. The pop-tart box is empty but I think she ate all of those beforehand. The MRE and the water jug are hidden under the blanket. I have just enough for one more Observe before my MP is at zero again, I observe the blanket. Nothing there except more trolling comments. It does give some points in comfort while in use, though

And…. its use is insufficient. My meditation attempt fails again, for the same reasons; bad environment, and too uncomfortable, it’s worse than before. More unread notification messages appear. Damn groin feels uncomfortably itchy as well. I took a look at them. Fucking great, there are new status effect penalties. ‘Uncomfortable rash’, no shit Sherlock, and Infection has updated itself to say ‘Skin Infection: Cellulitis’ and now has some minor penalties. There’s still no timer on it.

Waiting around yet more, I get yet another notification message. +2 relationship with Julia again. That’s odd. She still isn’t back yet. I get up, grab my water jug and the MRE and wander around again. I don’t want them to get swiped. Ah, the dispensary has ‘opened’ and a long line had already formed. I get in right away because I don’t want to miss out. Sometime later I see Julia hobbling about on some crutches and call her over. She holds a paper in her hand.

“Prescription?” I ask her.

“Yeah”

“You can get in front of me.”

“Really?”

“Yeah look at how long the line has already gotten”. Another unread notification pops up but I let it be.

“Thanks.”

“Doctors call you up?”

“Yeah, cleaned my leg, gave me new bandages, crutches, and told me to get antibiotics. Said you mentioned me, thanks again.”

“Sure. You finish off the cereal? I don’t care if you did. Didn’t see it on the cot, was curious.”

“No. Someone take it?”

“I guess so. You live on the island?”

“Yeah… I uh, don’t want to talk about that right now.”

“Right, sorry.”

And our conversation goes cold, another unread notification incremented. I whisper to check my notifications again; I gained +2 relationship with Julia, then lost one. At least it’s forward progress. I just wish I had some idea of how much was actually needed for friend status or what not.

****​

We stand in the line in silence for a while. Julia pulls her phone out a few times, and I manage to glance at the time. It’s a bit past one in the afternoon. I’m starting to get hungry again.

“Any luck getting a signal?”

“No, and the charge is almost gone.” Julia says as she puts her phone away again.

“How did it survive all the water anyway?”

“Partly waterproof, still had to dry it out last night.”

“You want to help me open up the MRE when we are done here?”

“Okay”

Silence again, at least between us, there is plenty of noise and chatter in the background. What feels like another hour has gone by, and people start leaving the line, so at least we move up. Something was going on. I see random people with food and carrying folded clothing articles, or outright changing in the street.

“I think some supplies got delivered.” Julia said.

“Dang, I don’t wanna lose our place in line, we’re pretty close now.”

So we wait in line instead, finally got up to the front, show our scripts and we get some meds, a bottle of pain pills and antibiotics for both of us. I asked for some topical antibiotic cream as well. The dude doling stuff out was nice enough to give me a tube of the stuff. One DING later and another objective had been achieved on my quests as I washed the meds down with some water. I really need new clothes though as the condition of my pants limited my ability to hold much in my pockets, and trying to carry two pill bottles, a tube of cream, an MRE, and jug of water with one arm broken is getting difficult. Julia has her own issues with holding stuff while moving around with the crutches. She manages to stuff her pill bottles into her pockets though.

“I’m going to hurry and try to figure out where those supplies came from, if you can hold the MRE. We can split it when I get back.” I say. Julia, nods as I awkwardly passed the thing to her then fast walk away to where the throngs of people are coming from. Julia can’t walk fast on her crutches.

It takes a while, trying to push my way through people, and avoid getting my arm bumped. I remember she is size 6 when I observed her, so if I found something that matched, I’d bring it to her, and claim I just guessed right. I push my way to the front of the crowd but there was nothing but empty pallets and cardboard boxes left. I should have known given the mood of the crowd and curses being uttered.

“That fucking sucks.” I say aloud joining my own curse into the stream as we all disperse again and I make my way back to the tent.

“Everything was gone by the time I got there.” I tell Julia as I get back. “We’ll have to look for another one. Hmm, where did the blanket go?”

“Somebody swiped it, while we were in line.”

“Damn, can’t leave anything unattended anymore. You want to split that MRE now?”

“Okay”

We eat in silence with minimal awkward conversation. It’s after 2pm now. I get another two relationship points out of it, but that’s it. I think my empathy skill got a few more percentages point too, but I don’t really remember what it was beforehand. That and I get a nice +4 HP for eating half the MRE.

Julia broke the silence after we finished. “They made some announcement while you were out. Another, larger tent-structure thing would be open soon.”

“The supply lady that directed me to the doctor mentioned that. For people that aren’t evacuated yet and have no place to sleep. Guess I’ll have to use it. Damn, I… I don’t even know where I live, if it’s on the island or elsewhere.

“I want to go see my house.”

“Yeah, well, if it’s not close, that’s a lot of walking through who knows what. We should get some shoes first.”

“We?”

“Um, well if you don’t mind me tagging along. I don’t have anything better to do.”

“You’re like a lost puppy.”

“Is that an okay?”

“I’ll think about it.”

“Well I should see if that other shelter place is open and register with them. You probably should too just in case. Then we can look for another supply drop if you want.” I hold my hand out to her to help her stand up. She takes it, but got that confused funny look again when she did so, and we head out of the tent.

****​

Another hour gets wasted waiting in line to register for the onsite shelter. Since we aren’t related they don’t place us near each other. Julia doesn’t have any issues; she actually has her ID on her. I don’t have squat, and can’t remember anything. Name? Simon Anderson. Age? 15. Date of Birth? Don’t know. SSN? Don’t know. Address? Don’t know. Parents, family? Don’t know. Don’t know, don’t know, and don’t know. The FEMA paper-pusher has the gall to start getting annoyed at me, for not being able to fill out his forms. Whom to release my info to? Fuck, anyone! If someone is looking for some kid named Simon Anderson I want to meet them, because I want to find someone that fucking knows me. One of his co-workers waives me along before I was about to make more of a scene. I get a printed picture of me and assigned a new cot. Yay, apparently that counts cause another DING went off toward my quest completion. Water, food, medicine, shelter down, now I just need info and clothing.

Speaking of info, there is a TV erected in a sort of common area at the front of the long hut building thing. I find Julia there. A lot of people are gathered around it watching the news.

As I watch the newscast, I was starting to get kind-of pissed. Everyone was applauding the heroes for saving Houston, for preventing Leviathan from attacking Houston. About how many lives and property had been saved because Leviathan was stopped before he could get into the major city. But Galveston was the battle ground. It was kind of like, ‘thanks Galveston; you really took one for the team’.

Then they finally get to the Casualties. Heroes first of course, a lot of names I don’t recognize. Some I did, like Gatling who I actually saw fighting. I shake off a flashback shudder again. Then civilian numbers, the city had a population of around 48 thousand, over half that were presumed dead, some 25 thousand people. Oh the reporters spun it; it was small potatoes compared to the likes of Kyushu and New Foundland, entire islands sank by Leviathan. Helicopter footage showed Galveston Island, huge chucks of it were underwater, other sections only semi-submerged and the buildings getting actively tossed by waves. The sea wall is gone. The I-45 is definitely collapsed. There are navy and coast guard ships stationed nearby.

After they brought some geologist on that said he would need to verify the stability of the island itself, and whether or not it could remain inhabited, I have to turn away. That is enough bad news. My stupid power apparently agrees and dinged to signal the completion of the information part of the objective.

I turn to look at Julia, she wasn’t the only one in the throng of watchers crying or carrying on about what they had just seen. Everyone’s mood went dark.

“I’m gonna go look for supplies. You wanna come with?”

Julia dried her face off with her filthy shirt, and hobbled after me. I stopped by a message board outside the hut and tacked my printed photo on it, and scrawled a message. ‘Simon Anderson staying here, if you know me or recognize my picture please seek me out and leave a message.’ The board is filling up with similar messages as well as pictures of missing persons.

****​

We learn how to chase helicopters. Well Julia did, she could see which ones flying overhead looked like they were holding supply palettes. I couldn’t see for shit that far away. Her crutches didn’t let us move very fast, but we were closing in on a drop we followed, but had gotten pretty far off from the shelter area. The streets look pretty wrecked. We even pass by a toppled boat that had been deposited on top of a house. I sure as hell hope the supplies had clothes, but anything would be nice.

There was a commotion up ahead where the supplies had been dropped. A crowd had formed, although several people were fleeing the scene. I hear someone talking loudly, and pause to let Julia catch up.

“Well, since the PRT, decided to screw us and give us fuck all in aid despite our help in the fight. We’re taking these supplies as a partial payment for services rendered. So GTFO you know? Unless you wanna pay your dues, cash, jewelry or a pretty face only. American Express not accepted.”

Two guys are in costume. A third is just wearing normal clothes with a bandanna covering his face. I recognize one of them, Rappel. He helped us at the mall. I don’t know the others. I blew most of my regened mana to observe all three.

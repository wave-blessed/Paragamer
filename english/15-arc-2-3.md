“Where do you think you’re going Simon?” Mrs. Beckett asked.

I was afraid of this. I had my backpack with me with the clay and such, needed to get the hell away from here before I tried the golem skill. I had gym clothes with me too just in case.

“Out, jogging.” I lied. I actually did not want to use Speech skill because I wanted to make an attempt at some other specialty at some point.

“You don’t need a backpack for jogging.”

“Jogging on a treadmill, at the gym, where I can also shower and change, hence the backpack.”

“You went there for the last two days. Shouldn’t you take a break?”

“It’s a trial membership; they only last for a few days. I have to use it or lose it. Unless you want to spring for the membership fees?”

“Nothing you can’t do here or jog around the block for.”

“Plenty I can’t do here, you don’t have weight machines. We had a sleet storm last night; it’s still cold and icy outside. The gym is nice and warm.”

“Then you could go out later, beside you should stay, we’re about to make breakfast soon.”

“When the trial period is over, they yeah I probably will do it later, if I can’t go there and you actually let me out to do stuff.” Because you really just want to keep an eye on me don’t you? “I already ate breakfast an hour ago anyway. Not my fault nobody else gets up when I do.”

“You tripped the motion alarm again this morning, you don’t need to be up that early.”

Yeah the fucking motion alarm. Why do they have them? Runaways, or in case of a psychopath invading the girls room, or just teenagers being teenagers, general paranoia or CPS regulations or who the hell knows. “I know it is really unusual for teenagers to get up early in the morning, but it is not unheard of. I do, and I am a light sleeper. I fail to see why I should be forced to stay in the room awake until some arbitrary time limit.”

“You could shower and do all your other morning routines beforehand…”

“I do! If I wasn’t, I’d be out even earlier. Look, it’s not my goal to wake anyone up. I try my best to stay quiet to be courteous of that. Ask Mr. Beckett, the only thing I was doing this morning was eating cereal downstairs and reading when he came out, to confront me, yet again, because of the absurd alarm. But I am going to keep getting up early.” Because I got shit to do and skills to grind lady! “And that alarm is going to keep going off. You and Mr. Beckett can keep losing sleep because of it, or you can just set the thing an hour earlier.”

“We could set it earlier, and we could set lights out an hour earlier too. I am sure all the other kids in the house would be pleased to hear about that because of you.”

See this is where I would really like to use observe, because I am pretty sure she is bluffing, but can’t use it to double check because I already started my buildings specialty attempt. “I think you’re trying to get me to comply by implying I would be seen as being blamed for the rest of the kid’s reduced evening time. I don’t think that would work out how you expect, when I can simply point that out to everyone instead. You won’t be able to sustain it either because of needed homework and study time when school starts next week. Also, you’d have to adjust your entire chore schedules. Furthermore if I am going to bed an hour earlier I’ll just get up an hour earlier too.”

She just started at me for a while.

“Can I go? I will be back before lunch.”

“Go. Lunch is at 1 pm.”

And I’m out the door and half jog down the street before she changes her mind. Shit no walk, don’t want to trigger an Athletics gain and ruin a specialty pursuit. Quick review, yep Speech went up, almost at level 5. No specialty there probably, even though I still had no idea what I would try to pursue yet. Also lost of point of relationship with Mrs. Beckett, I had been making such better progress with her previously; at least she is still in the positives, barely.

I’m sitting here at a picnic table in an obscure corner of a park, at seven-something in the morning, playing with clay. I did not think this through. It is cold, I am chilled, a status effect says so. There is still leftover sleet on the ground, but at least it is not actively precipitating. My hands are freezing, and I can’t work clay effectively wearing gloves. Plus, clay is really hard to work when it is cold, and insufficiently wet. A water bottle gave little help there. Did I mention it was it was freezing? Not literally, although it was early this morning. I should have indeed waited. Fucking Texas weather in January can still get cold but it will all be melted by noon, it might even be hot tomorrow.

I have been messing with this for over an hour, and I made a...thing, and also a mess. Artistry and Craft have both risen. I really hope this is sufficient. I place the lump of frozen malformed clay with uneven appendages into my backpack; hopefully the sides will obscure any views. I do a quick overhead scan with free camera to make sure I am alone within a given radius. Man, free camera leaves me really vulnerable; someone could coup-de-grace me if no one is watching my back.

Satisfied, I proceeded. “Create Mana Golem”

And nothing? No wait… there is a progress bar. Really? I sit I utter boredom as I watch it tick though. 1%...4%...7%, while it is doing so my Mana is steadily dropping. Maybe I can scry while I am waiting.

    Please wait until other tasks are completed before using this function.


Oh, fuck you. How long is this going to take? 15%...18%...21%... I removed my hand to scratch my nose.

    Golem creation interrupted. Restore contact in 10 seconds or process will be aborted and MP expenditure will be lost.



Fuck, I put my hands back on the hideous lump of clay. It looked like a failed attempt to make a bong that someone drew a face on and stuck too many legs on it. Who cares, just finish the quest. It never said it had to look good. At least I hope not, I should have used Observe on the skill description more, why didn’t I do that before I starting doing the building stuff? 25%...27%...30%...33%...

Dammit I really needed to pee. 36%..39%...42%...45%...

Oh fuck people. Some dude walking his dog… nasty use a pooper scooper a-hole! Go away now, please. 48%...52%...55%...58%...

Jogger… God damn she is hot. Fuck I can’t use free camera. 61%...64%...67%...70%...

Can I use observe on the buildings? No, wait till the task is complete. 73%...76%...79%...

How about meditation? No? Fuck you too. 82%...85%...88%...

90%...91%...92%. Oh come on, that’s worse than windows installation estimates. Wait why the fuck do I know that?

99%...

Five minutes later, 100%... followed by a bright flash in my backpack. Fuck did anyone see that? No? No one around? Thank god, or was that also an invisible effect? Probably wasn’t or the quest would not have offered a bonus to not get outed. DING!

    Quest Make your First Golem completed!

    Success: +250 XP, +1 skill level in Create Mana Golem

    Bonus Condition Success: +100 XP

    You’ve done it. It is probably the worst and ugliest golem ever made in the history of golems across the entire multi-verse, but it’s yours. Congrats, you must be so proud!



Well, fuck you too. It could be worse, at least it’s not a miniature screaming, eating, and pooping machine. I almost used observe on and realized I shouldn’t. At least it has an overhead tag.

<Unnamed Golem, Level 0 Construct, Dormant>

I had gained two levels in Create Mana golem; I guess one for making the thing and one for the quest bonus? That took all of just over half an hour, and 602 MP gone.

    You have created a Golem, it is currently dormant. Your current skill level supports the following commands:

    ‘[Name] Awake’: Costs 61 MP. Activates this golem so that it can receive commands and initiates the 3MP per minute maintenance. If you run out of MP an awakened golem will automatically go to sleep.

    ‘[Name] Attack’: The golem will attack a target you mentally designate, or if no target is specified, whatever enemy is the closest. It will continue to attack until its current target is incapacitated, destroyed or it is commanded to stop.

    ‘[Name] Stop’: The golem will cease executing its current command.

    ‘[Name] Follow’: The golem will follow to the best of its ability, the target you mentally designate.

    ‘[Name] Guard’: The golem will follow and guard the target you mentally designate, and attack anyone who attempts to attack, use, or take the target.

    ‘[Name] Sleep’: The golem will cease all actions and go dormant.

    ‘[Name] Status’: View this golem’s status information.

    Would you like to give this golem a name? Y/N



Sure, I type in ‘Golem 1’, because I don’t have any idea what else to call this thing, and I confirm my choice on the next prompt. What would have happened if I had made this before getting my nifty keyboard interface? The Golem feels a bit stiffer, but still cold and a bit slimy. However it no longer leaves clay residue on my finger when I rub it like the uncreated lump did when I was making it. Otherwise, it still looks exactly like an ugly lump of clay, and seems to weight about the same. Two pounds I assume given the extra 2MP cost it had above 600.

I took a look at its status page next,

    Name: Golem 1
    Level: 0
    Creator: Simon Anderson
    Controller: Simon Anderson
    Quality: Extremely Crude
    Size: Tiny
    Weight: 1.96 lbs.

    STR: 1 (0) 1
    AGI: 1 (+8) 9
    CON: 1 (0) 1
    INT: 0 (0) 0
    PER: 3 (0) 3
    WIS: 0 (0) 0
    CHA: 0 (0) 0
    LUC: 0 (0) 0

    Armor: 2.0
    Speed: 2.33
    Attack: 1.0
    Dodge: 6.0

    Health: 20/20

    Golems are immune to all non-movement binding status effects. They cannot gain XP. They are destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Their natural armor value is dependent on the material from which they were crafted. Their physical stats and HP are related to the type and mass of material from which they are created. Their movement, speed, and ability to execute commands well, are dependent on the quality and nature of their construction.

    Function follows form and aesthetics. A golem cannot move without limbs of some kind to propel itself with, and cannot grasp without hands or claws, etc.



Well it was an odd this according to its stats. It was pretty weak, but agile? Yet it had a lower dodge than myself. Was that because I gave it eight legs in an attempt to make it somewhat spider like? I gave it eyes, well I drew a smiley face on a clay ball that became its head. Is that what gave it a PER of 3? Just how far does ‘Function follows form and aesthetics’ let me go? And how skilled will I need to get in Artistry, Craft and this Golem skill to get past the ‘Extremely Crude’ quality marker?

Now for the next part, waking it up. I scanned around with free camera again to make sure I was relatively alone, and then command it to ‘Awake’. No flash or anything like before, but I certainly saw the mana go down and the overhead tag changed form ‘Dormant’ to ‘Active’.

I took it out of my backpack and placed it underneath the stone picnic table, and sat down at the other end and watched it. “Follow me”. I whispered. Wow, there it goes, it totally looks like it is drunk, but the thing ambled its way over to me in a dozen or so steps and stopped about a foot away. It was very apparent that it moved with awkward difficulty. My crafting job was not exactly symmetrical. Its legs were not the same length or thickness, nor even had the same number of ‘joints’, if they had any joints at all. Some of the legs seemed useless, not even touching the ground. At least it stayed up right, even if its ‘head’ lolled to the side to find whatever balance points it needed to walk.

“Attack” I intoned focused on the stone picnic table. The thing then started ramming into the stone legs of the table repeatedly. I let it do its thing for a few minutes, watching my own maintenance MP drop then noticed it had lost one HP, as a fleck of hardened clay broke off. “Stop”, it now stood motionless in its spot. There were a few scratch marks in the table, where it was ramming it, but nothing that I would consider even remotely significant. I am pretty sure if I had let it do its thing indefinitely, it would bash itself to pieces and the table would win.

Overall those commands were pretty limited and being so tiny, it seemed rather useless. Was this a useless skill after all or just crappy as it is now at such low levels? It says I could do up to 30 lbs. of mass now, I supposed that could hit harder than this thing. If I was at level 100, that would be 1000 lbs. of mass, and I suppose stone would be a lot harder and more durable than clay. However I would also have to create or sculpt those 1000 lbs. doing that would take a damn long time on its own. We’ll it’s something I can show at least. I put the baby spider-bong back into my backpack and commanded it to Sleep. It’s still fucking cold out and now I really did need to clean up at that gym or somewhere and get some other crap done.

****​

I blew through a lot of MP using Observe on buildings while headed to the Gym. I mostly just wanted to get all this clay washed off. I was having a hard time thinking of what other specialties I could try for while there. Since I already had weight-lifting, running and cycling, that didn’t leave much room. The broken arm also restricted me a lot still. They did have a number of scheduled classes, Yoga being one of them. I had to wait around for it to start though.

The instructor seems to be somewhat reluctant in letting me join, but did anyway. Not sure if it was because of my broken arm, or because I was on a trial membership, or because I was a teenage boy and most of the participants were women. An Observe would have been useful to help try and find out. While I was in there, I keep getting this weird feeling of familiarity, some ghost of a memory maybe, but could just never figure out what it was. It took an hour, but I still hadn’t gained a specialty but I was damn close to level 3. Hope I didn’t mess this one up as well. The class had primarily covered a bunch of stretching exercises, so when I got back to the house I went outside and tried doing the same thing for a while. Success finally got me a specialty for ‘Flexibility’. I thought it would be ‘Yoga’ but apparently not.

That accomplished I went in to read briefly before lunch. Julia was on the house phone the whole time so I couldn’t talk to her. I think she was talking to Mrs. Pearson. Then we had lunch which was equally busy without having privacy.

Finally seizing a chance when she wasn’t occupied I went up to speak to Julia. “Hey..”

“Hey.”

“There was something I had wanted to ask you about and show you.” Then the doorbell range.

“What?”

“Better to do it outside.” I said as I picked up my backpack, and we headed downstairs.

Mrs. Beckett intercepted us on the stairwell, “Julia, there is someone here to see you and Janet; You should sit down on the couch.” she said as we came down, I could hear her call for Janet after she got upstairs.

There was a police officer downstairs, but it was an older guy and did not look to have a normal uniform or at least not one like the Houston PD I had seen earlier. This was yet another case where I can’t just throw an Observe on this guy to get more clues, while I am trying for a specialty. Julia certainly did not look pleased.

“Can your thing wait?” she asked me. I reluctantly nodded in agreement.

“Are you Julia Catherine Mendez? Born September 24th, 1994?” He asked as she sat on the couch.

“Yes.”

A closer look at the guy’s uniform showed that although it seemed well dressed with tie and jacket and slacks, the patch on the arm that said coroner foreshadowed what he said next.

“It pains me to bring you this news, but I believe we’ve recovered your sister and your father’s remains from Galveston. I’d like you to come into the city for final verification if you can, go over what comes next and take possession of their personal effects.”

Julia steeled herself but I noticed her choking back a sob.

Then Janet came downstairs, apparently having heard the last bit of line and seeing the uniform as well, nearly stumbled as she mumbled ‘Oh God..’ Mrs. Beckett caught her though and let her to the couch as well.

“Are you Janet Melanie Greene, born July 15th, 1992?” Janet only nodded in response already beginning to shake.

The coroner went about his duty saying nearly the exact same thing in the exact same way in a well-rehearsed manner or had said it so many times to so many people already it came by rote. Janet’s parents had been identified and recovered off Galveston as well.

I hesitantly spoke up. “I lost some friends and family, in the same location her sister was recovered from.” I swallowed “Is there a way for me to look…”

The coroner nodded. “We still have many unidentified and unclaimed, you can come along and review photos.”

“I want to go too.” I heard Rachel speak up behind me.

****​

Getting though all of that was beyond awful, not as bad as during the attack itself but damn close enough. Julia and Janet were a wreck for the rest of the evening. Rachel and I weren’t much better off. Janet and Julia at least have some closure now, but Rachel’s family is still missing or unrecovered. Mine? I still have no idea.

I saw photos of Joe, Sandy and Dirk. Despite being made as presentable as possible, looking at them was an awful shock to my senses, mind and memories, Despite that no new information came to me. I hoped I helped them with Joe, because they had no ID on him, but I couldn’t remember his last name, I gave them all I could recall, which wasn’t much. Sandy and Dirk did have identification on them, but were yet unclaimed. I couldn’t claim them or do anything as I wasn’t family. I asked that if family did come to claim them, to let them know their friend (myself) was still alive and if possible, I’d like to speak with them. It was grasping at straws but what else could I consider?

I was hoping I would see a photo and my memories would trigger, and I could say that was my mother, father, sister, brother, weird Uncle Rob, friend from school, annoying neighbor, anything at all. Despite forcing myself to look through hundreds of photos of the dead, I got nada, except gaining almost another two full levels in Gamer’s Mind, but it felt like just another fuck you from my power.

I didn’t know what else to do. I contemplated trying to bring up the subject of being a Parahuman to Julia on the drive home, but every way I looked at it now seemed like a really bad idea. She now has to deal with finding a funeral home and burying or cremating them and her mother is still missing. This is after a horrible catastrophe. If the morgues are so overcrowded that they have spilled out into the neighboring counties and cities, the funeral homes and such would have to be far worse. Some other cold-hearted coroner officer (not the guy who delivered the news) said she needed the deceased out in 48 hours to make room for more.

The world had become well practiced though at dealing with the aftermath of Endbringer attacks. Wealthier countries like ours had funds set aside for survivors, cleanup and burials. Though it was often not enough; definitely not on an individual level. Mass cremations or mass graves were still occurred out of necessity.

With no need to save mana to awaken my Golem to show Julia at the moment I just blew it all observing buildings as we drove home.

Mrs. Beckett dropped Julia, Janet and I back off at the house. She went back out with Rachel to visit other morgues, so she could look through more photos of the dead. She gave us all stern warnings about behaving while she was gone, and that Mr. Beckett would be back from work any time now.

Julia and Janet went to grieve in their room. The boys and Melissa were watching some movie, Katy was away on some parental visit thing, and Joanna was watching cat videos on the computer again. No one was downstairs. I stared at the office door, tried it but it was locked, not unexpected. I’d never tried to pick a indoor house lock before. It was not a deadbolt like the front, a lot less complicated. I could take it apart, but I’d never get it back together fast enough if someone came down stairs. I’d throw an Observe at it, but stuck in buildings specialty mode.

What was it that feature I earned said? ‘Improvised Tools (hairpins, nail-files, screwdrivers, whatever works)’ I had access to all of those things right here in the house. I cranked up the volume for sound effects, that worked on both footsteps and car noises like if one came into the driveway or someone started going down the stairs. Then I got to work, several minutes later the office door clicked open, and my lock picking went up by over half a level. Several more minutes later and I hack the office computer to get an admin account access, +50XP. I saved force resetting the router for last, because Joanna was still on the computer upstairs.

That was what the web instruction had said the other day, to clear the password and force it back to the factory default password, ones which I already had looked up given the brand and model number. I put the hairpin in the reset hole and held it there for seven seconds. I heard Joanna get up and complain a few seconds afterwards. Luckily they didn’t have cable internet TV or everyone probably would have gotten up. Fully reset the router started booting back up and I got to the door as Joanna started down the stairs. I locked and shut it behind me and sat on the couch right as she came into the room.

“The internet is not working, where’s Mrs. Beckett?”

“Still out with Rachel. You can watch TV in here if you want, I’m done.” Joanna took that offer, so I got up and went back upstairs, and sat at the computer she vacated. I made sure no one was looking and I typed in the IP address of the router, and the factory default password. Success, +100 XP. That also put me to the next Computers, skill and prompted me for taking a specialty in ‘Networks’. Yes, sure thing I will take that. What specialty could I aim for next?

Julia had been given the personal effect of her sister and father, that which was salvageable anyway. She only bothered to keep some jewelry, and their cellphones, even though they didn’t work. Though I wondered if the phones could be repaired, or recovered in any way? Would she want me to?

    Phone Phreaker
    Repair or recover the data from Julia’s broken cell phones.

    Time Limit: 4 days
    Success: +100 XP per phone, improved relationship with Julia, ???
    Bonus Condition: +50 XP per phone, complete the task in 2 days.
    Failure: None


Damn, okay, that answers that. Since Julia had not come out yet I started to research smartphones on the computer right away, specifically how to repair and recover data from them. Computer skill started ticking upwards again. Mere web-browsing had not done that before. No, that isn’t true. It did when I was researching how to hack the admin accounts and the router. I guess researching/browsing things explicitly related to Computers gave me gains; whereas when I researched lock-picking that certainly didn’t net me gains in Computers.

I should focus. I don’t know the conditions of the phones, which is a rather important starting point. I’ll have to ask her about them. First thing to check will be if the various cards are intact. There has to be something recoverable though, a chance to succeed, or why get the quest? This makes me wonder yet again if there is some kind of precognition power going on with these quests. Why the bonus for doing it in two days? What other things might that affect vs. completing it at the later date?

Julia finally came out of the room. “Hey.” I said. She looked a disheveled mess, bloodshot eyes, and wasn’t even trying to hide the tear stains on her face.

“What did you want earlier?”

It was already pretty late now, and I heard Mr. Beckett’s car pull in, that meant dinner soon. I can’t throw this on her yet, it would be awful, and I would be awful for doing so. “Nothing, it can wait, given what’s happen today.” She simply sighed. “Though, I might be able to fix your…” I stammered a bit not know how best to phrase stuff. Maybe I should have activated speech, still trying to figure that out though. “The phones you got today, I might be able to fix them or get the data off them for you; if that’s something you want.”

She looked at me confused for a moment. “Why? Is that why you have those articles up on the computer?”

“Yeah, you don’t want to try and retrieve their contact lists? Have you informed anyone at all yet?”

She sniffled, and wiped at her eyes and face, though I think she didn’t have any tears left.

“Didn’t have the means…okay.” Julia got up and went back to the room, returned a moment later with two sealed plastic bags each containing a broken phone. Then Mr. Beckett called everyone down for dinner.

****​

Dinner was quiet, nobody wanted to talk. Mrs. Beckett and Rachel arrived about half-way through. Rachel chose not to eat, or she did later. Janet never came down from her room that evening and Julia said nothing before also leaving to go back upstairs quickly.

I went up stairs to work on those phones. Neither were working, but her sister’s phone, I assume it is her sisters because it had decorative girly stickers on the case, was intact. Her father’s was not. The phones did not smell good, but didn’t make you run away. The recovery people must have cleaned them up some.

The only thing I could do for her father’s phone was take it apart and retrieve the sim and memory card, the rest of it was a loss, or at least I was not even going to try fixing a cracked screen, case, and internal components. Her sister’s phone had a protective case and a screen protector, both of which went into the trash because they smelled like death. The articles said not to turn it on though, until it was very thoroughly dry. Given how long it was submerged and in the condition it was in, it needed to be super dry. After cleaning as best I could, wiping it down, and even taking the vacuum to it, (vacuuming was my chore tonight anyway), I took out its battery and cards. The articles said to stick everything in a zip lock bag filled with dried rice or desiccant, so I did with the rice. Maybe I can find some desiccant somewhere tomorrow. That was all I could do for this evening. Once dry, viewing the sim and memory card data would need a reader or a compatible phone to swap them into. Her father’s phone wasn’t really wet, but it also wasn’t compatible with Julia’s other phone.

There wasn’t anything else to be done by nightfall. I had hoped to research how to crack those combination locks, but got too busy with the other things that went on today. I used free camera again to Observe the houses in the neighborhood, I made some progress, but it became clear that I had exhausted all the ones I could see after wasting a lot of mana on ones I had apparently already looked at, and thus got no skill gain from. To make more progress there I’ll have to go out again tomorrow. All I can do now is practice meditation for a couple more hours and start all over again tomorrow.
